Hello tigers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is going to cover the lambda concurrent executions

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,310
limit.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,760
Now for the exam it's not actually necessary to remember loads and loads of limits so they're not really

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,010
going to test you on what's the limit for this and what's the limit for that but for lambda you do need

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:27,450
to be aware that there is a concurrent execution limit and that means it's basically a limit on the

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,430
number of functions that can be run simultaneously within the same region.

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,820
So do just be aware that there is this concurrent execution limit and it's basically a safety feature

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,690
to limit the number of concurrent executions across all functions in a given region per account.

9
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,430
And the default is 1000 concurrent executions per region.

10
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:57,400
And if you do hit the limit then you will see an error message and the error message is too many requests

11
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:06,010
exception and you might also see this HBP status code of four to nine and 1000 concurrent executions.

12
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:12,370
It's only the default and you can actually request that they increase that limit so you will need to

13
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,770
contact a W US support but you can do that through the console and you can just request that the limit

14
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:23,950
is increased so just be aware that if you have many lambda functions and they're all running in the

15
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:30,310
same region and then you suddenly start seeing new invocation requests being rejected then it may well

16
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:37,870
be that you've hit your limit and actually at a cloud guru or daily usage is around six point five million

17
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:44,170
lambda invocations per day every time you log onto our platform and you launch a new course or you start

18
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,660
a new lecture in the background it's actually a lambda function which is making everything happen and

19
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:56,590
yet we have six point five million lambda invocations per day and we run out of one region at the moment

20
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,880
so it's all running from U.S. East 1.

21
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:05,380
So as you can imagine for a busy website it is definitely possible to hit that limit.

22
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:11,260
And as I said before you can just request an increase by submitting a request to the AWB support center

23
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,360
or alternatively you can also configure something called reserved concurrency.

24
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,530
And this guarantees that a set number of executions will always be available for any critical functions.

25
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,780
So for example if you had a whole load of different functions and some were highly critical whereas

26
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,140
others were not so important to your application or to your business you can reserve some concurrency

27
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:41,080
for those critical functions to make sure that there's always a set number of concurrent executions

28
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,760
available for those critical functions.

29
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,200
However do be aware that it also does act as a limit.

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,760
So for example if you set a reserved concurrency of 500 for a specific function that specific function

31
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,950
will never be able to go over 500 concurrent executions.

32
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,600
So onto our exam tips.

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,780
Basically all you need to know about concurrent executions is that there is a limit so the limit is

34
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,580
1000 concurrent executions per second.

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,710
And of course just imagine you're running a service website like a cloud guru.

36
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,460
It's very likely that you would hit that limit at some point.

37
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:24,010
And if you do hit that limit you will start to see invocations being rejected and you'll start to see

38
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,830
HDP status code 4 2 9.

39
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:33,010
And the remedy is either get the limit raised by AWP support or if you just have a few very critical

40
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:39,580
functions then you can set a reserved concurrency to guarantee that a set number of concurrent executions

41
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,630
are always available to your critical functions.

42
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:49,390
So that is everything that you should need to know about the lambda concurrent executions limit if you

43
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,220
have any questions please let me know if not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

44
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,730
Thank you.
