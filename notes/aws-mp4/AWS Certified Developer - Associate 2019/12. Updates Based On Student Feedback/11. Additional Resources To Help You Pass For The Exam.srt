00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:07,290
Hello talkers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is just a recap on all the additional resources

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,570
that you can use to help you prepare for your exam.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,550
So we're going to be talking about the FAA cuz the white papers and the reinvent videos which are all

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,180
worth reviewing before you do the exam.

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:28,800
So first of all with the official AWOL FAA Qs and you can use these to find answers to commonly raised

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,070
questions about a W S services and they are written in a really concise way.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,190
So it's just a really easy way to check your understanding or double check that you've remembered everything

8
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,290
correctly about a particular w s service.

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,240
We're also going to talk about the white papers that you can read and these contain a wealth of information

10
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,740
about a W as recommended architectures.

11
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,160
Some really good diagrams as well as general guidance and best practices.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,500
And then finally we're going to cover some of the reinvent videos which are worth watching and these

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,030
often contain a lot of information about best practices deep dives as well as demos.

14
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,220
So let's take a look at the main cues that you should pay attention to.

15
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,990
For the developer associate and I've tried to group them together into loose categories.

16
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,380
So first of all we have the surveillance technologies.

17
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,180
So basically the main technologies that you would use to build service applications.

18
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:41,520
So think lambda API Gateway dynamo DP and elastic cache and also S3.

19
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:48,000
Secondly the development tools that you'd want to read up on or code commit code pipeline code deploy

20
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,820
and code build under security.

21
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:57,940
It's going to be identity access management Cockney toe and K M.S. for automation and monitoring.

22
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make sure you look at Elastic Beanstalk and cloud formation on the automation side.

23
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:09,310
And for monitoring look at cloud watch an x ray for containers you're going to need to know about elastic

24
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,590
container service an elastic container registry.

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:20,170
So definitely read through the FAA cues for those and for messaging and streaming it's Eskew us and

26
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,780
Kenneth this annual find all of the FAA cues on this page.

27
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,950
It's a W S dot Amazon dot com forward slash FAA kids and there's a link to this page in the resources

28
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:38,460
section of this lecture so you can basically just come to this page and find the FAA cute that you're

29
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,090
looking for.

30
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,600
So here's the lander thank you.

31
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:46,560
And you'll see it's just a really simple series of questions and answers and it's something that you

32
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,330
can really easily read through if you're having a break at work or if you've just finished listening

33
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:59,450
to a lambda lecture so moving on to the White Papers and here is a list of our favorite white papers.

34
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:06,310
And these are all well worth reading before you take the exam because they're full of a W as best practices

35
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:12,900
and sometimes they'll also just give you a new perspective on the same material.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,960
And don't worry there are links to all of these white papers in the resources section of the course.

37
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,840
But for developer associate it's mainly white papers to do with continuous integration.

38
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,110
Blue green deployments dev ops processes.

39
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,370
There's also service architectures with Lambda.

40
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:38,620
There's a really good one which covers Docker on a W S as well as optimizing your architecture using

41
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:46,390
surplus containerized micro services on a W S and of course a w s security best practices and that one

42
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,260
is important for all of the associate level certifications.

43
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:56,630
Now you might be thinking please no more white papers and I know they can be a bit long and a bit of

44
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,150
a drag.

45
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,110
Read some of them or even 100 pages long.

46
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,620
But I do have a few tips for getting the most out of them.

47
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:10,040
So first of all when I go to read a white paper first of all I don't just start reading it like a novel.

48
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,080
It's definitely not bedtime reading.

49
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,450
Instead I just browse through the entire document paying attention to the structure of the document.

50
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:26,660
Any headings tables diagrams etc. and I just try to get a feel for the material and then only once I've

51
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,620
finished browsing the document I just revisit this.

52
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,660
Only the sections that I think are worth reading so I try not to spend too much time reading over stuff

53
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,760
that I already know really really well.

54
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,130
For example if you already know identity access management policies really really well then just skip

55
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:43,750
through that bit.

56
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,790
Don't read over material that you already know.

57
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,420
I also try to keep in mind what I expect to get out of the White Paper.

58
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:58,590
So for example if I'm reading a white paper on security best practices I try not to get too bogged down

59
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:05,350
in the background detail and you really have to have a laser focus on what you expect to get out of

60
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,090
the white paper.

61
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:14,470
And then finally I always take notes and I don't mean pages and pages of notes just a few pointers or

62
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,290
keywords that you can review later on.

63
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:23,170
So basically anything new or anything that's coming from a slightly different perspective or anything

64
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,030
that you're struggling to remember.

65
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,390
So I just note that down so that I can review it later on if I need to.

66
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:35,930
And finally if you hate reading there are loads of really good reinvent videos available on the Internet.

67
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,150
And these are really good ones to watch.

68
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:44,250
If you really can't stomach reading a white paper and there are so many of these available I've just

69
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,990
listed my favorite ones to look out for when you're studying for the developer associate.

70
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,030
So you've got become an I am policy master.

71
00:05:53,190 --> 00:06:00,360
There's also one on continuous integration best practices moving to dev ops the Amazon way.

72
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:08,130
Getting started with Docker services architecture patterns and best practices and VPC fundamentals and

73
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:15,060
connectivity options and I've included links to all of these in the resources section of the course.

74
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,340
But of course you can always just head to YouTube and search for the technology that you're looking

75
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:28,790
for and you'll find loads of official reinvent videos available so I normally just head over to youtube

76
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,250
and search for a W.S. reinvent.

77
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:39,810
I and this will bring up all the relevant reinvent videos which are related to continuous integration.

78
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,980
So there's our continuous integration best practices.

79
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:49,940
There's also the IAM policy master that's coming up in this search as well for some reason VPC fundamentals

80
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:58,140
moving to dev ops deployment scenarios so you can see there's absolutely loads of official reinvent

81
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:03,420
videos and the great thing about YouTube is that you can watch everything on double speed if you want

82
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:10,140
to and these videos are sort of 40 to 50 minutes long so you can definitely get time to watch those

83
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,400
on your lunch hour.

84
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,800
So that is all the additional resources that I wanted to let you know about and they are all well worth

85
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,380
reviewing.

86
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,800
Before you go ahead and take the exam and don't worry there are links to everything in the resources

87
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,680
section of the course.

88
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,060
So that is the end of this lecture.

89
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,690
If you have any questions please let me know.

90
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,510
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

91
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,060
Thank you.
