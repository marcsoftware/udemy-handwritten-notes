00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,220
Hello bloggers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is all about a W S C L I pudgy nation.

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,850
So what does that mean.

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:18,710
Well with CLIA Padgett nation you can actually control the number of items included in the output when

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:29,220
you run an A W S CLIA command and by default it's going to return a thousand items per API call and

5
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,400
they call that the page size.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,730
So by default the WSJ CLIA uses a page size of 1000.

7
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,580
But what if you want to run a command which is going to return more than a thousand objects.

8
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:51,850
So for example if you ran a W S S3 API list objects on a bucket which contains over 2000 objects.

9
00:00:51,940 --> 00:01:00,280
So for example if it contained 2500 objects then the CLIA is actually going to make three separate API

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,040
calls to S3 but then it's gonna display the entire output in one go.

11
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,230
So it's actually making those three API calls in the background.

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:20,200
However for some situations you might find that this default page size of 1000 is actually too high.

13
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:26,050
For example if you see errors when you're running list commands on a large number of resources.

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,380
For example if you had an S3 bucket with well over a thousand objects and you would join to list the

15
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:40,840
individual objects within the S3 bucket you might see something like a time out or timed out error because

16
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,740
the API calls have exceeded the maximum allowed time to fetch the required results.

17
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:51,550
So it's just taking too long to return at the number of results that you have.

18
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,680
So how do you fix this.

19
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:59,860
Well you can actually adjust the default page size when you run your command and you basically just

20
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:07,270
add this minus minus page size option to tell the CLIA to request a smaller number of items from each

21
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,530
API call.

22
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,920
So the CLIA will still retrieve the full list of objects but it's just going to perform a larger number

23
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,970
of API calls in the background so it makes multiple API calls to get your results and then retrieves

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,180
a smaller number of items with each call and then it will just return to you the full list of items.

25
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,410
So I've got a couple of commands to show you.

26
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,010
So the first one is this a W S S3 API.

27
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:40,270
List objects and then you specify the bucket name and then you can actually specify the page size at

28
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,230
the end.

29
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,870
And in this example we're setting the page size to 100 instead of a thousand.

30
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:53,590
So if you had an S3 Buckets which contained over a thousand items and you wanted to limit the page size

31
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:00,640
to 100 it would just end up making over 10 API calls to get the results and then it will just return

32
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,910
all of the results to you in one go.

33
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,520
And then there's this other option that you can use with the list objects command.

34
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:13,800
And it's called Max items and this allows you to return fewer items in the CLIA output.

35
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,960
So in the example command we've got a W S S3 API.

36
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,050
List objects and then we're setting the bucket to my bucket and then we're setting the max items to

37
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,410
100.

38
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,710
So in this case instead of returning all of the items in the bucket it's just going to return at the

39
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,210
first 100.

40
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,720
So now I'm just gonna show you how to use those commands in the terminal.

41
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,540
And don't worry you don't actually need to know how to use these commands for the exam.

42
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,420
I'm just showing you because it's fun and to give you that background.

43
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:52,480
So here I am in the terminal window and I don't have a bucket which has thousands of objects in it but

44
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,330
I do have one that's got about 20 objects so that should be enough to show you the commands and show

45
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,300
you how they work.

46
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:06,100
So first of all I'm going to use this S3 API list object's command and this is just going to list all

47
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,920
of the objects in my bucket.

48
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,800
So there we are.

49
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:16,910
That's all my objects and I've got around 20 or just over 20 objects in this bucket so that's my output.

50
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:25,340
And I'm now going to run that same command again and I'm going to use a page size of five and I'm gonna

51
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,880
use a really low page size because we've only got 20 items in the bucket so I'm just gonna hit that

52
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,800
command again.

53
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,390
And there we are.

54
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:40,870
You'll see that even though we have a page size of five it's actually still retrieving all 20 objects

55
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,220
from my bucket.

56
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,750
So it's running multiple API calls to retrieve the contents of my bucket but it just returns it all

57
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,910
in one go as though it was just running it in one single command and then the other command I wanted

58
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,140
to show you is using the max items option.

59
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,220
And here is the command.

60
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:08,400
So we're still running exactly the same AWOL S3 API list objects we're specifying the bucket name.

61
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,090
And then we just add the minus minus Max items on the end of that command.

62
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,680
And I'm just going to set the max items to 1 hit enter and there we are.

63
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,920
It just returns the first item it comes to.

64
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,330
So that is just another way or another option for dealing with this timeout error.

65
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,710
And don't worry you don't need to know how to use these commands for the exam.

66
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,110
I'm just showing you because it makes it a little bit more interesting and a little bit easier to understand.

67
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,980
So what are our exam tips for a W.S. CLIA pageant Asian.

68
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,170
You just need to remember that if you do see errors like timed out or errors relating to too many results

69
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:55,520
being returned to a CLIA command all you need to do is adjust the pageant portion of the CLIA results

70
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,620
and that will help avoid any errors getting generated by too many results.

71
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,680
And in order to do that you just add the minus minus page size and adjust your page size so that it's

72
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,320
below the default of 1000.

73
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,430
And when you do this the CLIA is still going to retrieve the full list.

74
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:20,630
It just performs a larger number of API calls in the background but it will still return the full set

75
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,000
of results.

76
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,290
So that is everything that you should need to know for the exam about CLIA pudgy nation and dealing

77
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,480
with timeout errors on the CLIA.

78
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,240
If you have any questions please let me know if not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

79
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,750
Thank you.
