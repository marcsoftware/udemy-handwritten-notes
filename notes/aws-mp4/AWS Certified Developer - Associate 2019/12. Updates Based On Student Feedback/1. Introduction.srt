Hello bloggers and welcome to this section of the course.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,600
And this is just a quick lecture to introduce this section which is basically a few updates based on

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:16,780
student feedback and we won't be introducing any brand new topics is just a cover of a few additional

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,370
things that are going to help you score some extra points in the exam.

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:27,190
So as you know we rely on student feedback to let us know if they see anything in the exam which was

6
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,080
a surprise or missing from the course.

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:37,630
So if you do take the exam and you notice any topic that wasn't included in our course please do let

8
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,910
us know so that we can update and make the developer associate course as good as it can be.

9
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,300
So with that said if you've got time please join me in the next lecture.
