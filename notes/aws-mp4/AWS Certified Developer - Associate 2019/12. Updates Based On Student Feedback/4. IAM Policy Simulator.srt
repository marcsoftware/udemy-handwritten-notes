00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:07,190
Hello bloggers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is all about testing identity access management

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,820
permissions.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,160
So how can you test your identity access management permissions.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,270
Well there's this really great tool that you might not be aware of.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,970
And it's called the I am policy simulator.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:26,000
And this is a really cool feature which allows you to test the effects of identity access management

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,590
policies before you go ahead and commit them to production so you can use the I am policy simulator

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,730
to validate that a policy works as expected.

9
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:44,240
You can also use it to test policies which are already attached to existing users which is really great

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,750
for troubleshooting any issues where something's going wrong within a WAC and you suspect that it could

11
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,510
be identity access management related.

12
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:59,420
And let's face it if you've been working with a W S for a while oftentimes when something goes wrong

13
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,120
and it doesn't work as expected it can often be an authorization issue.

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,460
So can often be related to an identity access management policy not having the permissions that you

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,350
expect or not having enough permissions to do the things you're asking it to do and make the relevant

16
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,340
API calls.

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:24,470
So this is where the I am policy simulator comes in and you can access it using HD G.P.S. policy Sim

18
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:31,880
dot a w w or Amazon dot com and I'll also include a link in the resources section of the course as well

19
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,050
so you can just click on the link but I'm just going to show you it in action right now.

20
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:43,550
So here I am in the policy simulator so I'm gonna just start off in the user section and on the left

21
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:50,510
hand side you should see all the users which exist in your NWS account and if you've been working through

22
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:56,660
our labs or you've already been using a W S for a while you'll probably have a few different user accounts

23
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,580
to choose from.

24
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:04,250
But I'm just gonna go in and select this user called C.C. user which is one that we used earlier on

25
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,690
in the course for the code commit lab.

26
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:13,160
So I'm just gonna select that user and straightaway on the left hand side under I am policies it will

27
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,120
show you the policies which apply to this user.

28
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,950
So these are the policies that have been attached to my user.

29
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:25,940
And you can use the simulator to test whether a certain action is allowed or not by the policies attached

30
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,900
to the user.

31
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,500
So first of all I'm gonna go in and select a service and I'm going to select Athena because I think

32
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,020
this user it's got code commit full access and it's got access to the easy to contain a registry as

33
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,600
well for the elastic container service.

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,770
So it definitely doesn't have any permissions for Athena and I'm gonna go in and select an action just

35
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,770
select run query and then I'm gonna hit run that simulation.

36
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,780
And then under the results it should tell you whether the action that we've selected.

37
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,670
So that run a query for Athena so it should tell us whether that would be allowed or denied based on

38
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,050
these policies.

39
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,350
And it's showing us permission denied so implicitly denied because there are no matching statements

40
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,100
relating to that action.

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,330
So now I'm gonna clear my results.

42
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,940
And now let's try and simulate an action which should be allowed.

43
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:26,710
So this user has got code commit full access so allows you to do all of these different actions in relation

44
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,240
to code commit.

45
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,060
So I'm gonna change all service to code commit and I think they're in alphabetical order.

46
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:42,310
There is code commit select an action just going to select the very first action and hit run simulation

47
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,330
and straightaway you should see that has been allowed.

48
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:52,960
We have one matching statement so click here for details and we can see that it's in this code commit

49
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:59,070
full access policy we can show the statement and it will even find that statement for us there.

50
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,990
So you can see it's actually a really cool feature which allows you to simulate actions and it will

51
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,610
let you know whether those actions would be allowed or denied based on the policies attached to your

52
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,870
user.

53
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:17,370
I'm just going to hit back in the left hand side panel back again.

54
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:24,020
And you can see you can actually select groups or roles as well so you can go in and run those same

55
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,010
simulations.

56
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:36,320
Based on different groups so you select a group select a service and select an action and run a simulation

57
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,440
and you can do the same for roles as well.

58
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:45,800
So that is the I am policy simulator and it's definitely worth spending a few minutes having a play

59
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,650
around with it.

60
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,700
But as you can see it's pretty simple to use.

61
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,550
So let's move on and take a look at some of our exam tips.

62
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,170
So our exam tips for the I.M. policy simulator are you just really need to know what it is and what

63
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,510
you can use it for.

64
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,370
So it allows you to test identity access management permissions before going ahead and committing them

65
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,730
to production.

66
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:16,070
For example if he had some IBM permissions attached to a test user group or role you could go in and

67
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:22,550
use the simulator to test the permissions before adding those permissions to your production accounts.

68
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:29,240
You can also use it to validate that existing policies work as you expect and you can test policies

69
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,460
attached to existing users groups or roles.

70
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,640
And this is really good for troubleshooting and it just making sure that your policies work as expected.

71
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,080
And finally you can access it using this link.

72
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,830
So it's just HDP P.S. policy Sim dot a W S dot Amazon dot com.

73
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,430
So that is the end of this lecture.

74
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,790
If you have any questions please let me know.

75
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,170
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

76
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,800
Thank you.
