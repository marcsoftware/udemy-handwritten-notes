Hello bloggers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is all about Eskew.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,610
Delay cues and also managing large messages in Eskew s.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,520
So let's get started.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,610
So what are rescuers delay cues.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:22,620
Well these allow you to postpone the delivery of new messages in escudos so you can postpone the delivery

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,760
to a queue for a number of seconds.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:32,640
And this means that any messages sent into the delay queue actually remain invisible to any consumers

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:39,900
of the queue for the duration of a delay period which you set and the default delay for a delay queue

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:47,020
is zero seconds and the maximum is nine hundred seconds which is 15 minutes.

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,400
So for standard excuse queues this doesn't affect the delivery or the visibility of any messages which

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,920
are already in the queue.

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,190
It's only going to affect new messages arriving in the queue.

13
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,850
However if it's a FIFO queue this is going to affect the delay of any message which is already in the

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,240
queue.

15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,880
So when should you use a delay queue.

16
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,650
Well with large distributed applications you might need to introduce a delay in processing somewhere

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,170
along the line for your application.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,410
You might even need to apply a delay to an entire queue of messages.

19
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,450
For example imagine an online retail application where you might want to introduce a delay of a few

20
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:38,250
seconds in order to allow for updates to a sales or stock control database before sending out notifications

21
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,730
to your customers confirming an online transaction.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,490
So for delay queues the main thing that you need to know is what they are and what they can be used

23
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,180
for.

24
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,760
So just remember that they can be used to delay or postpone the delivery of new messages in escudos.

25
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:03,120
Moving on to managing large messages in escudos while the best practice for managing large escudos messages

26
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:11,930
is to actually use s three and when we say large ask us messages I mean messages which are over 256

27
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,650
killer bytes and up to two gigs in size.

28
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:22,080
So the main thing to remember is that you can use S3 to store these messages but in order to do that

29
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,960
there's a couple of things you're going to need to also configure.

30
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,320
So first of all you're going to need the Amazon escudos extended to client library for Java and this

31
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:38,940
is going to allow you to manage the messages when they're in S3 and you'll also need the W.S. SDK for

32
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,350
Java as well.

33
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,380
And that just provides an API for the S3 Buckets and object operations.

34
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:51,860
So it's that SDK which allows you to get and put and delete objects from the S3 Buckets.

35
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,060
So in order to use S3 to store your messages you're actually going to need both of those both the extended

36
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,110
client library and also the SDK for Java.

37
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,930
So the rescuers extended client library for Java.

38
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:11,550
It allows you to specify that messages are either always stored in S3 or only the messages over a certain

39
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,050
size.

40
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,050
For example only the messages over two hundred and fifty six kilobytes.

41
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,310
It also allows you to send a message referencing a message object which is stored in S3 and also get

42
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:30,890
an delete message objects from S3 now you don't need to know how to set this up for the exam.

43
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,830
The main thing that you need to know for the exam is that when you're dealing with large messages in

44
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,730
escudos it's really useful to be able to store them in S3.

45
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,900
And for that you're going to need the W.S. SDK for Java.

46
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,480
The Eskew has extended library for Java.

47
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,470
Of course you're going to need an S3 bucket as well and you can't just use the normal a WSOC Ally.

48
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,560
You can't do it using only the console.

49
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:02,290
The NWS management console or the ESC U.S. console you can't do this using just the escudos API or any

50
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,580
of the other a W S SDK.

51
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:11,460
So just remember the things that you're going to need to use in order to manage your large excuse messages.

52
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,870
So moving on to our exam tips.

53
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,450
Just remember that you can use the excuse us delay queue if you need to postpone the delivery of new

54
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:25,830
messages messages in your delay queue remain invisible for the duration of the delay period and it's

55
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:34,690
zero by default up to 900 seconds or 15 minutes and you can use delay queues for large distributed applications

56
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:41,620
which might need to introduce a delay in processing in order to avoid errors in the application and

57
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,370
for managing large messages in rescuers.

58
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,230
Just remember our exam tips.

59
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:52,630
So if you have large messages up to 2 gig store them in S3 and in order to do that you're going to need

60
00:04:52,630 --> 00:05:00,820
to have an S3 Buckets and you'll also need to use the w w SDK for Java as well as the escudos extended

61
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,330
client library for Java as well.

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:10,660
And just remember you can't do this using the regular a W SC ally or the management console or the escudos

63
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,450
API so that is everything that you should need to know about delay queues and managing large messages

64
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,190
in escudos using S3.

65
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,640
If you have any questions please do let me know.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,250
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

67
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:24,840
Thank you.
