00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,800
Hello tigers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is going to cover lambda and V.P. seas but

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,190
more specifically enabling lambda functions to access resources in your VPC.

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,410
So let's get started now.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,790
As a developer you may well see a situation or a use case where you are developing a lambda function

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:32,370
and it needs to be able to communicate with or access resources which are inside a private VPC in a

6
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,910
private subnet with no access to the outside world.

7
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:44,880
For example imagine a service website running on lambda which needs to read or write data from an audio

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,100
database or alternatively a lambda function which goes in and shuts down a compromised easy to instance

9
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,620
in response to a security alert.

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,010
So those are just a couple of examples of situations where you may need to enable access to VPC resources

11
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,380
for your lambda functions.

12
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:12,650
So how can we enable this because by default your lambda function will not be able to access any resources

13
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,830
within a private VPC without some additional configuration.

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,200
So basically you need to allow the function to connect to the private subnet and Lambda will need the

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:32,090
following VPC configuration information so that it can go in and connect to resources in your VPC.

16
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:39,440
So first of all you're going to need to provide the private subnet I.D. where your resources are located.

17
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:46,370
You also need to provide a security group I.D. with specific access for the lambda function to allow

18
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:52,430
it to do what it needs to do and lambda is going to use this information to set up an elastic network

19
00:01:52,460 --> 00:02:01,360
interface or an eye using an available IP address from the side a range of your private subnet and you

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,840
can add this VPC information to your lambda function using the command line and you just need to use

21
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,470
the VPC dash config parameter.

22
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,770
And here is an example of the command that you can use to do that.

23
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,660
So it's a W S lambda update function configuration.

24
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,180
And this is if you're updating an existing function so you need to then provide the name of your function.

25
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,920
And in this example the function is called My function.

26
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,760
And then finally at the end you provide the VPC config information.

27
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:41,680
So we provide the subnet I.D. and the security group I.D. as well and it's going to use the subnet I.D.

28
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:49,060
to identify a spare IP address to assign it to the elastic network interface for the lambda function

29
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,000
and it's gonna use the security group to allow it to access the private subnet and do what it needs

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,710
to do.

31
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,700
But let me show you in the console as well because it's actually really easy to do this in the console

32
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,120
too.

33
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:09,760
So here I am in the console and I'm just gonna head down to Lambda under compute click on Create function

34
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,840
make sure that auto from scratch is selected and we're just gonna provide a function name.

35
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,350
I'm just gonna call it VPC dash lambda and accept all of the other defaults.

36
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,840
Just click Create function.

37
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,270
So that is my function created.

38
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,770
And it is just the basic hello world function.

39
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,880
So I'm gonna just click on configure test events call my test event T1 click on Create and then we can

40
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,360
test it so it's just basically the hello from lambda demo function.

41
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:49,330
So if we scroll down past the function code you'll find this network section here and it's here where

42
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:56,320
you actually provide that VPC config information and you'll see that by default it's not allowed to

43
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,660
access any VPC by default.

44
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,050
And if we want to add that VPC information we just select this dropdown.

45
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:10,040
You can just select any VPC within your account for the region that you are operating in.

46
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,550
And the only one that I have is the default VPC.

47
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:19,780
So I'm just going to select that and then asks you to select at least one subnet and they actually recommend

48
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:25,390
that you select two subnets in two different Availability Zones for high availability.

49
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:32,470
So I'm going to select one in U.S. one be and then it's asking me to select a second one I'm going to

50
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:41,520
select a ust one see as well so that's my two subnets and it then asks you to select a security group.

51
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,840
So I need to select a security group from that subnet.

52
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,800
I'm just going to select the first one on the list and hit save.

53
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,900
Let's just check that if that's been successful.

54
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,190
Okay.

55
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,510
So we've had an error message up here saying your role does not have VPC permissions.

56
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,090
Now in order for this to work you need to have you need to make sure that the execution role assigned

57
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:09,090
to your lambda function has permissions to go in and create elastic network interfaces.

58
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,510
There are a bunch of VPC permissions that you need to include in your execution role.

59
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,070
So let's just calm down and take a look at our role.

60
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,150
So this is the existing execution role that it's created for us.

61
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,320
But I'm just going to tell it to create a new one from a W S policy templates and we're going to need

62
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,250
to give our new role a name.

63
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,040
So I'm just gonna call it VPC lambda role and hit save.

64
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,280
And hopefully that should have been successful if we come to the top.

65
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:45,310
No errors here and you should notice in the lambda design a view that we've now got permissions for

66
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,650
Amazon easy too.

67
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,090
So let's take a little closer look at that and we now have the permissions to create network him to

68
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,620
faces delete network interfaces and describe network interfaces.

69
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,170
So it's these actions that lambda needs to have access to in order to create the network interface that

70
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,280
it's going to use when it accesses resources in your VPC.

71
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,300
So hopefully that all makes a bit more sense now.

72
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:16,270
And of course you can just go in and go into functions select your function and then delete your function

73
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,940
when you've finished exploring that so hopefully that makes a bit more sense now.

74
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,840
And let's go and take a look at our exam tips so all we need to remember for the exam is that it's possible

75
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,680
to enable lambda to access resources which are inside your private VPC but it's not something that is

76
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,880
enabled by default.

77
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,080
And if you do want to enable it you need to provide this VPC config information to the function and

78
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,630
you can do it either using the command line but don't worry you don't need to remember or memorize the

79
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:54,980
command line command and you can also do it really easily using the console as well you just need to

80
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:01,840
select your VPC provide the private subnet I.D. and a security group I.D. as well.

81
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:09,290
And once again lambda uses that VPC information to set up an elastic network interface using an IP from

82
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:15,620
the private subnet side arrange and then the security group that you provided needs to allow your function

83
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,640
to access resources within the VPC.

84
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,260
So that is the end of this lecture.

85
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,550
If you have any questions please let me know.

86
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,130
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

87
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,760
Thank you.
