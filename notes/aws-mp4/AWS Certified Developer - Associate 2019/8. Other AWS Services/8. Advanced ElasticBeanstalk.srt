OK hello cloggers and welcome to this lecture this lecture is on advanced elastic veins.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,710
Now this is just going to be a theory lecture because we're just going to keep it simple.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,080
But it's really important to understand going into your exam that you can customize your elastic beanstalk

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,080
environment using a plastic beanstalk configuration file.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,470
And this means you can define packages to Instow you can create Linux users and groups you can run show

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,400
commands you can specify services to enable all you can even go in and configure your load balance so

7
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,650
much you can do.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,900
These files are written in either in YAML or in Jason format and they can have a file name of your choice

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:47,250
but they must have a dot com fake extension and they'll all be saved inside a folder called Dot E B

10
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,350
extensions so you can have any filename that you want but it's got to have a dot com fake.

11
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,850
And though these files all have to be saved inside the folder dot Eby extensions.

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,200
So where is the extensions folder.

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,920
What must be included in the top level directory of your application source code bundle.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,030
So this means that the configuration files can be placed under the source control along with the rest

15
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,780
of your application code.

16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,840
So you probably will get a question going into your exams about how to configure elastic beanstalk deployments.

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,490
You just use the config files and they all must be saved in the dot.

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,540
Ebay extensions photo which must be in the top level directory of your application.

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,540
Remember that.

20
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,780
Here's an example of my health check.

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,050
You r l dot com.

22
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:37,470
So in this example way using Jason and in this example we're telling our lastic load balance the application

23
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,940
health check you are ill and we're just saving this in a config file with code up my health check our

24
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:50,550
old config and this would be saved in the IP extensions folder in our root directory.

25
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,110
So that's really it.

26
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,900
That's my advents elastic beanstalk tips.

27
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,370
So just remember that you can customize your elastic beanstalk environment by adding configuration files.

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,550
Files are going to be either written in Yemen or in JSM the files can have any name that they want but

29
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:11,430
they've got to have the dot config extension and these dot config files are all saved to the DOT Ebby

30
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,720
extensions folder.

31
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,200
And this must be located in the top level directory of your application source code bundle.

32
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,920
So if you have any questions please let me know.

33
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,270
If not feel free to move on to the very last elastic things Stuart lecture where we talk about elastic

34
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,800
bands with D.S..
