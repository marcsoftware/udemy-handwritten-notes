00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,760
OK hello cloggers and welcomes this lecture lectures on consensus and we're going to go ahead and set

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,590
up our own Kinney's to stream.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:13,350
So it is a lab and you're going to need to log into the AWOS console and the cloud formation template

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,670
that we'll be using is available in the resources section of the course.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,040
OK so I in the AWOS console and I just want you to go up and change your region to Northern Virginia

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,950
so U.S. East one.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,210
Because basically we're going to be using a confirmation template and we want to make sure all the resources

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,090
within that cloud formation template are available if you're using it in a new or a region like London

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,450
for example it might break the lab.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,220
So once you've done that we need to go over to cloud formation and cloud formation is under our management

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,050
tools and we click on cloud formation and now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,320
we're going to create a new stack and we're going to instead of using a template we're going to specify

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,300
an Amazon S3 template to our own.

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,710
Now I will paste this into the resources section of the course or just copy and paste that link and

15
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,550
then paste it into here.

16
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,530
Well go ahead and hit next.

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:19,530
That stack will give it a stack name of Mike nice stack and we will leave everything else as default

18
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:27,530
if you want to use and easy to keep in order to be able to S-sh into your to instance that's doing both

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,550
the data consumption and production.

20
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,810
You can I'm just going to leave it.

21
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,030
I'm going to leave it as T-2 my career.

22
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:41,100
And we're going to use the application archive this get hyperlink in here that's contained within the

23
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,210
club formation stack.

24
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,670
You don't need to worry about getting that.

25
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,020
Well go ahead and hit next.

26
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,210
Optionally you can put in tags I'm just going to leave everything else as default.

27
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,700
Go ahead and hit next.

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,210
And we'll go ahead and create our stack.

29
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,550
Now don't worry about this error message up here.

30
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,020
Just scroll all the way down.

31
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,870
Acknowledge that the club promotion is going to create I am resources and go ahead and hit create.

32
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,750
And now what will happen is your confirmation template will start creating your kidney system.

33
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,250
And this can take anywhere from or up to between 10 to 15 minutes.

34
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,930
I'm just going to pause the video and wait for this stack to be created.

35
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,960
OK so it says My status is create complete.

36
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,180
I just hit refresh and click on events.

37
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,500
I can see all the different events that has happened in within that stack and now what we want to do

38
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,980
is we don't click on outputs and it's giving us a u r o here and this you our show is essentially both

39
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:41,100
our data producer and our data consumer So it's both artificially creating the data fitting it into

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,500
the streams and then it is essentially connecting back up and taking that data and consuming it.

41
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,670
And if we actually click on the link it will create this nice little graph.

42
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,030
So this is essentially just simulating the number of hits on different Web sites.

43
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,860
It's not real data at all it's just a simulation and it's just using random numbers.

44
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,130
You can leave this running you know for a couple of minutes and see you know the visualizations but

45
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,560
essentially all you're going to see is these different lines moving up and down randomly across a time

46
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,050
stamped map.

47
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,560
So I'm back in the console in the cloud formation stack.

48
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:25,480
Let's go ahead and have a look at what's been created so we can go into a C to be able to see our AC

49
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,350
to instance that is running the CC to instance like I said it's both the data producer and the data

50
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,370
consumer.

51
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:39,660
If we go back over to here and if we actually go down into Isas psychoanalysis is down the bottom and

52
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,910
it's under the analytic section we click into consensus.

53
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:49,380
We can see in here if we go over to Canossa streams will be able to see how can the sustainment says

54
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,680
Mike in a systemic Canossa strength.

55
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,530
We can actually click in here.

56
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,630
This gives us all the details so we've got to open Shad's right now.

57
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:04,860
Our data retention period is 24 hours and we can increase this up to seven days or 168 hours and then

58
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,610
our Shaab level metrics.

59
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,620
Basically instead of it being every five minutes we're producing our metrics at every one minute.

60
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,990
If we were going to enable it's are very similar to detailed monitoring we click up into the monitoring

61
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:24,670
section we can actually monitor our sheilds now so we can see what is going on inside our can ease the

62
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,570
strain and can have a look at all the different data there and what is sexually doing's it's storing

63
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:37,120
this data in Dynamo database when we come back here and go over to our dynamo D-B database.

64
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:44,730
You'll be able to see in tables if you click in tables you can see our our different tables are being

65
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,080
created.

66
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:53,340
So let's just click on this one and go over the items and you can see in here the large amounts of items

67
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,750
that is being stored every second.

68
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:01,970
Inside our dynamo D-B table so this really is just a high level view of Kinney's is to give you a little

69
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:08,110
bit of hands on experience really going into the exam you expected to know the difference between can

70
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,250
streams and the cease fire hose.

71
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,340
You also need to know what can he say analytics is at a high level and that's about it.

72
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,420
So now if you just click back Hurby here we're going to go and delete everything so we just need to

73
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,490
go back into cloud formation.

74
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,420
Click on here and just go actions and then delete stack.

75
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,190
And we're going to go ahead and delete this stack and all the resources that exist within that stack

76
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,540
and now going to be deleted as well.

77
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,000
So that's it for this lecture guys if you have any questions please let me know if you see anything

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,830
in your exam on Kinesis that you felt the course hasn't covered.

79
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,930
Please also let me know and I'll create additional contact.

80
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,660
But like I said content.

81
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:51,900
But like I said the two things you really need to understand the difference between Kinesis firehose

82
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,290
connects to streams and can ysis analytics.
