00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,970
OK hello cloggers and welcome to this lecture this lecture we're going to look at how we can deploy

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,830
applications with elastic beanstalk.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,790
So I've created two very very simple web sites.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,920
We've got version one and version two.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,580
You'll be able to download version one in this sleb and in the next lab you'll be able to download version

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,390
to it's in the resources section.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,870
So do you go ahead and download that.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:31,590
Basically it's an index dot page pay photo and a photo of a shirt that we have called AWOS this week

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,060
which is a show we run every single week to keep you updated with AWOS it's on our YouTube channel.

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,940
So what we're going to do is we're going to deploy this app in a PH P Apache stack using elastic beanstalk.

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,890
So once you've downloaded it just keep it as a zip file.

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,100
You don't need to unzip it unless you want to have a look at the files and then you need to log into

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,660
the AWOS console.

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:59,020
OK so here I am in the console consul going to go over to services elastic beanstalk sits under a computer

15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,430
you can see it here and cloud formation actually sits under management tools cloud formation as a way

16
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,070
of scripting your infrastructure whereas elastic beanstalk is a way of provisioning your environments

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,970
using a Cooey effectively.

18
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,190
So we're going to click on elastic Bhain Stolk and you'll see this splash screen if you haven't used

19
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,810
it before.

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,230
I'm currently in the Northern Virginia region.

21
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:26,180
I'm going to go ahead and get started and I'm going to call this application name let's call it hello

22
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,970
cloud gears.

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,960
Now the platform I'm going to choose ph pay and then I'm going to instead of using a sample application

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,360
I'm going to upload my code to I'm just going to click upload and then it says source code origin local

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,550
file choose file and you can see my two files in here we've got version one and version 2.

26
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,640
I'm going to use version 1 for this.

27
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,990
Gonna go ahead and hit open then I'm just going to go over here and hit upload.

28
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,750
That is now uploading it is actually uploading it to and S-3 bucket which it's going to create and then

29
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,760
I'm going to go ahead and hit create application.

30
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,030
So this can take a little bit of time.

31
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,980
It can take about basically five or six minutes.

32
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:12,120
So I'm just going to pause the video and wait for my lastic beanstalk environment to come online.

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,480
A case that took about four minutes you can see here it says successfully launched environment.

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,810
Hello cloud gurus EMV.

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,190
So if I could go and click on applications I'll be able to see it in here.

36
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,300
Hello cloggers.

37
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,350
Ian Vink.

38
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,580
And then if I click in here I'll be able to see that it's up and running.

39
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,830
And hopefully if I click this link we should get a live web site.

40
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,650
And here we go hello cloggers.

41
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,300
This is version 1.

42
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:35,840
Ms.

43
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,350
Fey doing AWOS this week so deep Lyn's is now general availability.

44
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,940
We actually just ordered one into the office so expect some courses on that soon.

45
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,560
And if you actually click on the link you'll be able to see our YouTube channel and you'll be able to

46
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,630
subscribe I would recommend subscribing because it's the easiest way to keep up to date with AWOS every

47
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,160
week you can see that the videos are between two to three minutes long.

48
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,330
So very easy to watch on your way to work.

49
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:06,350
So back in the AWOS console I'm back in my elastic store environment in here we've got our configuration

50
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,520
so this is how we go and configure our environment.

51
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,150
Right now we're just using a T1 micro.

52
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,730
It's a very basic instance.

53
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:19,710
We could go in here and add additional instances going here and can figure out load balances in here

54
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,660
we've got our deployment policies.

55
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,030
How do we do updates to our Web site.

56
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,610
And we're going to cover that off in a lot of detail in the next lecture because that is basically the

57
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,080
main thing you're going to be tested on going into your developers so shit.

58
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,800
Exam on elastic Bane's still.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,790
Over here we have our logos health monitoring alarms managed updates manage updates basically where

60
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:49,560
you can configure updates to your operating system updates to let's say page Fe or two you know Apache

61
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,420
or something like that.

62
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,860
And you do this during it to find predefined configuration window.

63
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,550
So might be at 3 a.m. every Sunday in town here with events and tags as well.

64
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,170
So let's go back to what dashboard.

65
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,200
I am going to end the lecture here.

66
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,210
We are going to go ahead and learn all about updates like I said that that is pretty much the most important

67
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,970
thing to know going into the developer associate exam.

68
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,230
So if you've got the time please join me in the next lecture.

69
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,630
Thank you.
