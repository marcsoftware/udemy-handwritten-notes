00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,840
OK hello club yours and welcome to this lecture this lecture we're going to look at audience and elastic

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:14,190
beanstalk so elastic so stalk supports two ways of integrating an audio database with your beanstalk

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,260
environment and you can launch the audience instance from within the plastic bins store console which

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,360
means the audience instance is created within your elastic beanstalk environment.

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,550
And this is a typical use case with this would be for Debb and test deployments.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,280
However this might not be ideal for production environments because it means that the lifecycle of your

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,020
database is tied to the lifecycle of your application environment.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,900
So if you go in and terminate the environment the database instance is going to be terminated too.

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,960
So just remember if you couple audience an elastic beanstalk together it means that when you go in and

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,050
delete your elastic beanstalk environment it is going to go in and delete your.

11
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,500
Yes.

12
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,810
Instances well and that could not be ideal for production systems.

13
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,990
So for production environments the preferred option is to decouple the yes instance from your your elastic

14
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,200
beanstalk environment.

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,780
So you should launch it outside of elastic beanstalk directly from the RDF section of the AWOS console.

16
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,840
And this gives you a lot more flexibility it allows you to connect multiple environments to the same

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,300
database.

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,480
You could have multiple lastic beanstalk environments connecting into your instance and it provides

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,540
a wider choice of database types because you can choose any database that is supported by audience and

20
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,490
also allows you to tear down your application environments without affecting your database instance.

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,670
So how do you do this.

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,700
Well you need to do two things essentially two additional configuration steps required.

23
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,380
The first is that an additional security must be added to your environments or Terschelling group and

24
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,210
then you'll also need to provide the connection string configuration to your application service.

25
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:54,450
So this is going to be your database or your address and point the password and the user name and then

26
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,130
just the connection parameters in order to connect into that database.

27
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,140
So that is it you just need to remember that going into your exam that there's two different options

28
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,840
for launching your instance you can launch it within elastic band Stolk but do remember that when you

29
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,210
terminate the elastic beanstalk environment the database is also going to be terminated.

30
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,560
It's quick and easy to add your database to elastic things still can get started.

31
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,320
But this would typically just be suitable for Dev and test environments only.

32
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,950
The other option is you can launch outside of elastic stork's you do this by going into the D.S. console

33
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,630
and provisioning your instance additional configuration steps are required.

34
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,380
You're going to need to create a security group and you're going to need to parse the connection string

35
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,060
to your application.

36
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,590
This is definitely suitable for production environments because it gives you more flexibility and it

37
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,450
also allows you to have connections from multiple environments and you can tear down the application

38
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,650
stacks without it impacting that database.

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,820
So you have done really well you are at the end of this section of the course and the next one we're

40
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,860
just going to rehash everything that we've learnt in this section of the course and then we'll be able

41
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,330
to move on to the next section.

42
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,460
So if you got the time please join me in the next lecture.

43
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:05,880
Thank you.
