OK hello cloggers and welcome to this very quick lecture comparing s.c.s versus asinus.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,790
So what is s.c.s.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,040
Well as he stands for simple email service it's a scalable and highly available email service designed

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,160
to help marketing teams and application developers send marketing notification and transactional emails

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,260
to their customers using a pay as you go modals So it's basically sending out marketing emails.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,110
It can also be used to receive emails incoming e-mails can be delivered automatically to an S3 bucket

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:37,060
and incoming mails can actually be used to trigger lambda functions and S and S notifications.

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,400
So s.c.s is email only right as soon as you can do things like text messages.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:50,100
You can do things like you know add to ask us Qs published a hasty and points et cetera s.c.s is email

10
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:50,540
only.

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,320
And when you think of marketing e-mails.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,840
Best way to remember it.

13
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,980
So it's for automated e-mails.

14
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,070
You can have purchased confirmations shipping notifications or status updates et cetera.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,080
So you could have a mobile phone company that needs to send an automated confirmation email every time

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,250
a customer purchases a prepaid mobile phone.

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,350
You know how two minutes it's used for marketing communications advertisements newsletters special offices

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,820
office et cetera.

19
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,870
And this could be an online retail business that needs to let its customers know about what sales promotions

20
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,480
its got on as well as discounts.

21
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,760
So a quick comparison s.c.s again like I said email messaging service Estan as it's a pub sub messaging

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:39,540
service and it has a whole bunch of different formats and not just email but S.M. s TDP Eskew cetra

23
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,150
s.c.s can be used to trigger lambda functions or S and S notifications.

24
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:52,380
Same with s and s it can be used to trigger lambda functions and then it can also be s.c.s can be used

25
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,600
for both incoming and outgoing mails whereas S and S can actually fan out messages to a large number

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,530
of recipients and you can replicate and push messages out to multiple endpoints and formats and not

27
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:12,600
just e-mails but like we said as MSH TDP ask us and as well as e-mails with s.c.s an email address is

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:19,380
all that's required to start sending messages to a user with S and S consumers must subscribe to a topic

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,550
in order to receive the notifications.

30
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:28,200
So s.c.s is essentially asynchronous whereas essence is synchronous so someone has to go in and actually

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,740
subscribe to a topic to get those notifications.

32
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,320
So one of my exam tips just remember that s.c.s is for emails only can be used for incoming and outgoing

33
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,970
mails.

34
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,720
It is not subscription base.

35
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,890
You only need to know the person's email address whereas S and S supports multiple formats as ask us

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,280
TGP as well as e-mail push notifications only it's a pup submodel So consumers must subscribe to a topic

37
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,460
and you can fan messages out to large number of recipients.

38
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,800
So multiple clients each with their own s Ask Qs.

39
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,880
So that is it for this lecture guys if you have any questions please let me know.

40
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,840
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

41
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,350
Thank you.
