00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,660
OK hello cloggers and welcome to this lecture lecture we're going to look at camis API calls and this

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,480
is the main thing that you're going to be tested on in the certified developer associate exam.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,340
So the best way to do this is we're going to create a little easy to instance we could do the API calls

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,490
using pi or Java ph PE or whatever.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,180
I'm actually just going to do it at the command line because it's a lot easier and that way doesn't

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,990
matter what language you know you'll be able to follow it.

7
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,160
So if you've got the time please join me in the ATO as console.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,000
OK so here I am in the AWOS console.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,470
I'm just going to change my region.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,800
Make sure you provision your AC to instance in the same region where you provision geochemist key in

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,520
the last lecture.

12
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:48,270
So I did mine in London going to go over to AC too and I'm going to go ahead and launch an instance.

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,530
I seem to already have it running instance which is annoying because it's costing me money so quickly

14
00:00:53,530 --> 00:01:00,090
going to terminate this instance instance State terminate and go ahead and say yes and then I'm going

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,160
to go ahead and launching new instance.

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,540
I'm going to use the Amazon Linux.

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,320
I am going to configure my instance details just leave everything as default.

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,700
We all were using this instance for is to use the command line again to go ahead and add my tags.

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,720
I'm not going to tag it for anything.

20
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,750
Gonna select an existing security group so hopefully I've got a security group with port 80 and port

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,490
22 open.

22
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,200
If you don't just go ahead and create one and go ahead and hit review and launch and then I'm going

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,190
to go ahead and launch my engines.

24
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,980
I'm going to create a new keypad because I'm not actually sure where my last campaign was.

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,090
I'm just going to call it mine.

26
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,580
London K.P..

27
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:43,080
So my London pay and download that key pair is just going to close this and I'm going to go ahead and

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,130
hit launch.

29
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,130
It's going to take a couple of minutes while I do that.

30
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,600
I did not note down my secret access key for my users so my user who's going to do the encryption and

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,720
decryption what I need to do is just click on encryption keys and make sure you change all region to

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,020
where it is that you were Bicester minds EU.

33
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,970
London.

34
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,430
My encryption key in here so my user who was going to do it.

35
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,410
Let's just have a quick look at our key administrator.

36
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,260
So this is my key manager.

37
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,920
That's suppose an administrative administrates the key my key user is.

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,060
Mine Crypta and you can actually also add external accounts to use this key to encrypt and decrypt So

39
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,190
be aware of that as well.

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,770
But you can't yet add an external account to do the actual management of that case.

41
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,260
So if my user name is encryptor.

42
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:44,680
So let's go over to users and grab my encryptor in him and what I want to do is his security credentials.

43
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,160
Essentially what I'm going to do is I'm going to make that that access key inactive and then I'm going

44
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,640
to go ahead and delete it.

45
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,650
Then I'm going to create a new Access case to create access.

46
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:03,240
And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this secret access key into my clipboard and I might

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,630
even just paste it into a notepad so I have it for a little bit later.

48
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:14,970
Case I'm going to just go back over to easy to grab my public appear address or running instance am

49
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,920
just going to grab this public IP address in there and then.

50
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,270
What I'm going to do now is S-sh in to my easy to instance case I'm in my terminal window going to run

51
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,700
S.H. 400 for my London key Pead rpms.

52
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:35,370
You'd only need to do this in OSX suffusing party or anything else in Windows you don't need to do that

53
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,910
and I'm now able to S-sh to easy too high for use.

54
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,730
And then at my public IP address there minus I and then my key names are my London keypad.

55
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,010
P am sure you want to continue to yes.

56
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:57,650
Can elevate my privileges to roots are are or su and I'm going to go ahead and clear the screen.

57
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,170
OK so we're now ready to start using the command line.

58
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,350
So let's go ahead and create a plain text file that we're going to encrypt.

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,010
I'm just going to type in Eker.

60
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,840
Hello cloud gears.

61
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,430
And then I'm going to output this to secret.

62
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,750
TIA ex-state.

63
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:19,400
And if we want to type in LS We can see secret ticks T.

64
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,690
We want to read the contents we just type kept secret.

65
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,850
T s t.

66
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,010
And we can say hello Klau gears.

67
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,500
Now we want to do is we want to go ahead and encrypt this using our encryption key before we can do

68
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:31,960
this.

69
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:38,160
We what we need to do is configure our user accounts so we need to just run AWOS configure and we're

70
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,540
going to have to pass AWOS our access key ID and our secret access.

71
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,930
So my Access Key ID is this my secret access.

72
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,680
Is this my default region name.

73
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,950
Now I am using London which is us too.

74
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,020
Going to type EU west and then to.

75
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,510
So that would put me into London.

76
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:02,520
Make sure you type the default region name for the region where your keys stored remember Kamis is regional.

77
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,180
It is not global despite the rest of it and being global.

78
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,760
And I'm just going to change my default output format as default.

79
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,030
So what I want to do now is I want to take my secret ticks.

80
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,770
And I want to encrypt this I'm going to clear the screen just to make it a lot easier to see.

81
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,190
And you will be able to get all of these commands in the resources section of the coast to saved as

82
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,660
a text file.

83
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,140
So here is that ticker tape so we're going to run for commands.

84
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,360
We're going to encrypt our plain text files so we're going to encrypt secret optics take hold encrypted

85
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,670
sacret then going to decrypt it into another text Cocco decrypted sacret then going to run re-encrypt.

86
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,060
And this is going to take our encrypted sacret and encrypt it.

87
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,080
Run a basically decrypt and then re-encrypt it.

88
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,480
Except it doesn't create a plain text file when it does that.

89
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,220
And then we're just going to quickly look at this command which is enable key rotation.

90
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:01,320
We won't be able to do it using our current user simply because they do not have administrator access

91
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,530
or you know they do not have permissions access to the case.

92
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,140
But you still need to know is this command going into your exam because you will be tested on it as

93
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,680
well.

94
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,800
So let's go ahead and grab our key I.D. you can see it appears here three times.

95
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,190
I'm here in the AWOS console.

96
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:22,080
All I need to do is click on services and I need to go to identity access management and I go over to

97
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,900
my encryption keys I'm going to change my region to two.

98
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:31,530
I think it was London and in here I'm going to grab my key I.D. So this is my key I.D. him going to

99
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:37,440
copy that into my clipboard and I'm just going to paste it three times into my text file so I can just

100
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,400
literally cut and paste these commands as we go.

101
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,100
So let's go ahead and paste that.

102
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,900
OK so let's go ahead and get started.

103
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,990
I'm going to copy this into my clipboard.

104
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,950
We're going to create our first file which is encrypted secret RTX.

105
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,120
OK so quickly just check this directory.

106
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,900
We've just got secret ticks.

107
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,150
If I can get that we can see that it just says Hillary cloggers.

108
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,820
Let's paste the first command in here.

109
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:09,110
So we have now just encrypted it using our encryption key and we've called it encrypted secret dot ticks

110
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:09,890
T.

111
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,530
Type in LS I can see that I've got a new file encrypted secret thought ticks.

112
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:21,330
And if I kept encrypted secret dot ticks I can see that it is encrypted it is no longer in plain text.

113
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:28,710
Let's go ahead and clear the screen grab my second command which was to decrypt my encrypted sacret.

114
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,960
So I'm just going to copy that into my clipboard and paste it in here and hit enter.

115
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,340
And then if we type in LS We can now see decrypted secret dot ticks.

116
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,250
So I kept that decrypted secret tactics.

117
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,850
They go it's been decrypted.

118
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:48,140
Last thing I want to do is just re encrypt the file so I'm going I'm going.

119
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,060
Going to do this using the first encrypted secret.

120
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,550
So it's going to clear the screen in here we can see the re-encrypt command.

121
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,230
So I'm just going to copy that in there and it's going to encrypt it into new encryption that takes

122
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:07,020
it's going to paste that into my clipboard from my clipboard and if I type in LS I can now see this

123
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,000
file and this file is now called new encryption takes place and your encryption takes tea.

124
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:18,510
Now a cat that new encryption ticks hey you can see it's now encrypted again.

125
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,550
It's going to clear the screen.

126
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,700
We're going to look at our fourth command and this is to enable key rotation.

127
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,570
So AWOS Kamis enable key rotation that in and hit enter.

128
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,360
Interestingly this user does have the privilege to do that.

129
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,290
So I was mistaken when I said that they would not have the privilege.

130
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:41,130
So we have now enabled key rotation on this and the rotation would just rotate this key every single

131
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,080
year so that it's a new key each year.

132
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,480
So let's go ahead and have a look at my exam tips.

133
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,470
So what are my exam tips the camis you do need to know these for API calls and what they do.

134
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,570
So we've got AWOS Kamis encrypt and this is at the command line.

135
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:03,870
But if you are using you know if you're using the DKs the key ones or encrypt decrypt re-encrypt and

136
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,310
then enable rotation so encrypt all encrypt decrypt it will decrypt it.

137
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,870
Re-encrypt will basically take your encrypted one and instead of decrypting it into plain text it will

138
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,610
actually Wudi Crypta.

139
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,380
But it will.

140
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,780
Re-encrypt it immediately and destroy it.

141
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,600
The plane takes one straight away and then finally if you want to enable key rotation you just need

142
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,690
to say enable rotation.

143
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,600
Very straight forward.

144
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,300
That's pretty much all you really need to know about the API calls going into the developer associate

145
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,850
exam.

146
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:39,260
You will need to understand what a master key is and what envelope encryption is as well.

147
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,970
So we're going to cover that off in the next lecture.

148
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,120
So if you got the time please join me in the next lecture.

149
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,500
Thank you.
