OK hilar cloggers and welcome to this very short theoretical lecture on what envelope encryption is

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,590
a Kamis envelope encryption.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,670
So envelope encryption is simply the process of encrypting your envelope case your envelope K is essentially

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:25,340
your key that you use to encrypt your data and what the AWOS camis you know system does is we basically

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:31,710
we take what's called our masticate or our customer master key we use this to encrypt our envelope key

6
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,060
and our envelope key is what's used to encrypt our data.

7
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,200
So that is all it is.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,710
It's basically encrypting a K we're basically encrypting the key that encrypts our data.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,340
So that is all envelope case or sometimes is a cold day to case.

10
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,350
So when we go into our decryption with AWOS we have our data.

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,370
This is encrypted.

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,110
So this is our envelope.

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,200
And in order to encrypt that we take the kamis service and we use our masticate.

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,640
And we do an encryption algorithm and we use that to decrypt our data.

15
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,520
And we turn that data into basically plain text and then we take out plain text data.

16
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,270
And we use that to decrypt our data.

17
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,330
So that is literally all it is.

18
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,980
So what do my exam tips will just remember that the customer masticate is used to decrypt the data.

19
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,300
Which is sometimes referred to as our envelope K and then our envelope K is used to decrypt the data.

20
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,850
That is all you need to know and understand for camps for the developer associate.

21
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:39,270
Now if you are interested as we go through it in an awful lot of data go as well as cloud HSM and the

22
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,750
security specialty and it is actually quite fascinating stuff especially using cloud HSM because cloud

23
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:53,250
Hudood security modules up until just last year actually were very expensive to get any hands on experience

24
00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:00,670
with and even using AWOS Hunwick security modules up until last year you still had to pay $5000 a month.

25
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,540
So if your student wasn't very easy to get experience.

26
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,490
Great thing is Amazon's changed that pricing model now and you can get hands on experience with hardware

27
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:14,200
security modules using cloud HSM and you just pay by the hour.

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,480
So do check that out.

29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,620
It is in the security specialty.

30
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:23,020
So let's go on to the camp summary lecture and then you're done with the kamis section of the course.
