00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,600
OK hello cloggers and welcome to the summary lectures.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,970
You're at the end of the camis section.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,270
I understand it was pretty much very very you know fast section of the course but it does come up in

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,400
the developers so that you can go in and delete that E.S. to instance by the way we are no longer going

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:17,900
to use it.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,980
And you can go ahead and delete OK's.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,110
One thing to note when you delete your key is you have to disable it first and then you basically have

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,080
to share it.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,840
And it would take between seven to think it's 30 or 35 days in order to delete.

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,060
Let's have a quick look at how we can do that.

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,210
So here I am and the U.S. consulate.

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:40,230
I'm just going to go over to I-AM which is under security identity and compliance.

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,160
Can it go over to my encryption case.

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,840
I was doing mine out of London.

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,560
I'm just going to click in here and we can say my key in here.

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,680
And then what I'm going to do is go to key actions and I'm going to disable it first then I'm going

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,820
to go and click on this key and I'm going to go to actions should locate deletion.

18
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,810
It's between 7 and 30 days ago.

19
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,790
I'm going to show you all this to be deleted within seven days and hit show George elation.

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,330
You can't delete it immediately.

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,490
You have to wait a minimum of one week.

22
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,730
That doesn't actually come up in the developer associate but it does come up in the certified security

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,630
specialty.

24
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,100
So moving on to my exam tips just remember what camis is.

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,220
It's a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys that are

26
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,760
used to encrypt your data.

27
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,650
So integrated with a whole bunch of different services including abs S3 redshift elastic trans Koita

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,500
work meio are LDS and some others to make it simple to encrypt your data with encryption keys that you

29
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,400
manage.

30
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:44,730
When we do this we create a custom Ammal sticky on the customer Masaki consists of an alias so its name

31
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,610
its creation date its description the key state.

32
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,520
So whether its been enabled or disabled which is what we just did then and then the key material and

33
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,300
this can either be customer provided or provided by AWOS.

34
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,970
And remember that case in camps can never be exported Kaysing cloud hates us and can terms the actual

35
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,750
physical underlying hardware.

36
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:13,770
Its multitenant hardware but its basically multitenant HSM as well as cloud asem as dedicated HSM device

37
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,870
thats dedicated to you and we do again this often a lot more detail in the certified security specialty

38
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,080
to set one up.

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,880
All we did is we went in and we created an alias and gave it a description.

40
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,180
We chose our key material options so we use the Amazon provided one.

41
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:37,140
We then defied our administrative permissions which I am users roles can administer the K and then we

42
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,410
defined the usage Kamis permissions so which end users or roles can actually use the key to encrypt

43
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,240
decrypt data.

44
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,580
We then went through all the material options.

45
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,360
Again sorry I just repeating myself but we either use the kamis generate a material or your own case

46
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,320
material.

47
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,460
We do look at how you can employ your own material in the certified security specialty.

48
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,350
You will definitely have to know these API calls.

49
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,700
So if you want encrypted data using crypt you dont need decrypt your data use decrypt if you want to

50
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,180
re-encrypt your data use re-encrypt if you want to rotate ukase enable key rotation.

51
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,010
Do not use re-encrypt for key rotation.

52
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,250
You always want to just use rotation McCay rotation so bear that in mind.

53
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,360
And then finally we looked at you know envelope encryption.

54
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:34,140
So we saw that the customer masticating is essentially what we use to decrypt the data the data.

55
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:40,320
So this is our envelope came within the envelope and we use this to decrypt our actual data.

56
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:47,300
So envelope encryption is just a way you take the K that you use to encrypt data and you encrypt that.

57
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,250
So that is it for this section of the coast.

58
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,450
You are ready to move on and you are getting very close to the end.

59
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,250
So if you go to any questions please let me know.

60
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,210
If not feel free to move on to the next section.

61
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:57,720
Thank you.
