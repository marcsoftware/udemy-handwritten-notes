Hello bloggers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is all about SARS and the assume role with

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,550
web identity API.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,190
So let's get started.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,040
So what is assume a role with web identity.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:22,290
Well it's an API which is provided by S T S. which is the security token service and it returns temporary

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,400
security credentials for users which have been authenticated by either a mobile or web application using

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,690
a web identity provider like Amazon Facebook or Google.

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,600
And of course for mobile phone applications they recommend Cockney toe and underneath Cockney toe is

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,670
actually making the SD as you roll with web identity calls on your behalf.

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,710
So when you use Cockney Toad you don't explicitly need to use this API.

11
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:57,380
However for regular web applications where you're not using Cockney so you can use this sd s assume

12
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,760
role with web identity API.

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:07,310
So let's take a look at an example workflow and we have our user on the left hand side here and she's

14
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,780
going to authenticate using Facebook Google or Amazon.

15
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:19,500
And once she's successfully authenticated the web I.D. provider passes back a JWT token to the application.

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,100
The application then makes the assume role with web identity API call to SDF and as part of that API

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:34,680
call it provides the JWT token SDF then exchanges the JWT token for temporary credentials so an access

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,240
key and secret access key.

19
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:42,040
Finally the application can use those temporary credentials to access a W resources.

20
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,180
For example dynamo DB tables or the contents of an S3 bucket.

21
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:53,740
So let's take a look at a sample response that you might see when your application makes a call to assume

22
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,360
a role with web identity.

23
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,680
Now the main two things that you need to know about the sample response are that firstly it responds

24
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:10,770
with this assumed role user a R N and the assumed role I.D. and both of these are simply a R and or

25
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,640
Amazon resource.

26
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:19,440
Name identifiers and these can be used if you want to refer programmatically to the temporary credentials.

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,720
So if your application code needs to later on refer to the temporary credentials.

28
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,360
These are the identifiers that it's going to use and it can be a little bit confusing because it's referring

29
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,700
to roles and I.D. It's nothing to do with identity access management roles.

30
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,570
Just remember it's the specific a or an identifier that you can use to programmatically refer to the

31
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,090
temporary credentials and then the next section that I've highlighted is the credentials themselves.

32
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,990
So you get a session token and then you get a secret access key and access key and these are temporary

33
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,050
and by default they're only going to last for one hour before they expire.

34
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,500
There's an expiration time stamp included as well.

35
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,630
So let's take a look at some of our exam tips for assume role with web identity.

36
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,720
Just remember it's part of the security token service.

37
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,260
It allows users who have authenticated with a web identity provider like Facebook Google or Amazon to

38
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,120
access a resources temporarily.

39
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,750
Once the user has authenticated with the Web I.D. provider the application then makes the assume role

40
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,630
with web identity API call.

41
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:33,400
And if it's successful SPSS will return temporary credentials enabling access to a W US resources.

42
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:41,100
And just remember this assumed role user a R N and the assumed role I.D. those are used to programmatically

43
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,580
reference the temporary credentials.

44
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:50,580
They're not related to an identity management role or user they are simply a are NS used to programmatically

45
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,260
reference the credentials.

46
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,240
So that is everything that you should need to know for the exam about assume role with web identity.

47
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,790
If you have any questions please let me know.

48
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,280
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

49
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,790
Thank you.
