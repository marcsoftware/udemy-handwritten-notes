Hello Clockers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is all about cognito you suppose.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,290
So let's get started.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,260
So what are you.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,150
Applause.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,720
Well these are directory's which are used to manage sign up and sign in functionality for mobile and

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,350
web applications.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,610
Users can sign in directly to the user pool or in directly for an identity provider like Facebook Amazon

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:39,450
or Google and Kokanee type acts as an identity broker between the ID provider and AWOS successful authentication

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:48,780
generates a number of Jason web tokens known as J.W. ttys and there's also this notion of identity pools

10
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,920
and identity PPO's enable you to create unique identities for your users and authenticate them with

11
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:03,840
identity providers and with an identity you can obtain temporary limited privilege AWOS credentials

12
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,530
to access other AWOS services.

13
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,620
So let's take a look at an example.

14
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,170
We call our user here.

15
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:18,720
And the first thing she does is she looks in via Facebook and receives her JWT tokens.

16
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:25,680
Then the cognito identity pool exchange is the JWT token for AWOS credentials.

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,330
And these are temporary credentials which she can then use to access AWOS resources and cognito handles

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,860
all this for you.

19
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,000
You don't have to write any special code for your application.

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:46,630
It manages receiving the JWT tokens from Facebook and the exchange of those tokens for AWOS credentials.

21
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:55,370
Cognito also tracks the association between user identity and the various different devices they sign

22
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:01,590
in from and in order to provide a seamless user experience for application.

23
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,720
Cognito uses a technology called Push synchronization to push updates and synchronize user data across

24
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:17,960
multiple devices Amerson S.A. or simple notification service is used to send a silent push notification

25
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,300
to all the devices associated with a given user identity.

26
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,260
Whenever data is stored in the cloud changes.

27
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:36,530
So what are the exam tips for cognito remember cognito use is use up polls to manage users sign up and

28
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,330
sign in either directly or via a web identity providers.

29
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,060
Think Facebook Amazon and Google.

30
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:51,630
It also acts as an identity broker handling all interaction with the web by dead sea providers and it

31
00:02:51,670 --> 00:03:00,020
uses push synchronization with Asinus to send a silent push notification of use of data updates to multiple

32
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,340
device types associated with the same user ID.

33
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,460
So that is the end of this lecture.

34
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,100
If you have any questions please let me know.

35
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,860
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,230
Thankee.
