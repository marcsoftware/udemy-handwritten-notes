00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,380
Like lurkers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is all about in line managed and custom policies

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,300
within identity access management.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,260
So let's get started now.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,380
Identity access management is used to define user access permissions within AWOS and we've used.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,470
I am a lot throughout this course.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,900
Now there are three different types of policies available.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,510
Firstly manage policies then customer manage policies.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,970
And finally in line policies.

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,930
So let's take a look at those three different policies in a little bit more detail now.

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:49,400
A managed policy is an eye and policy which was created and administered by AWOS and they provide managed

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,980
policies for really common use cases based on job function.

12
00:00:53,990 --> 00:01:00,300
So for example don't MIDP full access code commit power user.

13
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:06,710
Easy to read only access etc. and we've used these roads many times throughout the Lap's that we've

14
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:14,980
done so for example when we've created an easy to instance needs to create or query a tiny IDB table.

15
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:22,860
We use that Dynamo ODP full access managed policy in combination with a service role to give our easy

16
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:31,420
to instance access to the Dhanam IDB tables and these ws provided policies allow you to assign appropriate

17
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:39,460
permissions to your users groups and rows without having to write the policy yourself and the policies

18
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,120
are all written in Jason.

19
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,920
Are all fairly complex and comprehensive.

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,730
So it just takes away that heavy lifting of creating a policy yourself.

21
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:57,350
And a single managed policy can be attached to multiple users groups or rows within the same IWM accounts

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,860
and across different accounts.

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,660
But there's one important thing to know about the Mohnish policies is that you cannot change the permissions

24
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,060
defined in an AWOS managed policy.

25
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,800
Moving on to customer managed policies and a customer managed policy is a standalone policy that you

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:24,610
create and administer inside your own AWOS account you can attach this policy to multiple uses groups

27
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:32,700
and rows but only within your own account and to create a customer manage policy you can take a copy

28
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,780
of an existing AWOS manage policy just copy the gyse on code and customize it to fit the requirements

29
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,160
of your organization.

30
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:48,540
And this is recommended for use cases where existing AWOS manage policies don't quite meet the needs

31
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,770
of your environment.

32
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:59,020
Finally we have policies and an in line policy is an identity access management policy which is actually

33
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,210
embedded within the user group or role to which it applies.

34
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:10,240
And there's a strict once one relationship between the entity and the policy that means you cannot attach

35
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,560
an inline policy to multiple users groups or rows.

36
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,550
And when you delete the user group or role in which the inline policy is embedded the policy will also

37
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,790
be deleted.

38
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,850
Now in most cases AWOS recommends using managed policies over inline policies.

39
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:37,290
However they are useful when you want to be sure that the permissions in a policy are not inadvertently

40
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:43,850
assigned to another user group or role than the one for which they are intended.

41
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:50,730
For example if you're creating a policy which must only ever be attached to a single user group or row

42
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:57,060
for security or technical reasons and if you come into the WS console you can take a look at the different

43
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,280
types of policy that are available.

44
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:06,890
So scroll down to identity access management click on policies and you can filter based on policy type

45
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,640
and it's showing me either customer managed or AWOS manage.

46
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,950
So first let's take a look at my customer managed policies and these are the different policies that

47
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,640
I have created myself.

48
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,020
And if you go into these policies you can actually edit the policy and actually change the Jason code

49
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,670
that makes up the policy.

50
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,070
So I'm just going to click.

51
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:35,450
So go back to my policies and click on AWOS managed and you can see they provide lots of different managed

52
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,290
policies for various different types of access.

53
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:45,530
So depending on whether you need Read-Only or full access or down to administrative access and they

54
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,740
give you lots of different policies for all different types of services.

55
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:56,150
And the interesting thing about these policies is if I select one it's not going to let me edit it so

56
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,190
I cannot change this just on code.

57
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,790
And that's the important thing to remember about a managed policy does not give you the option to edit.

58
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,860
And in fact it says down here on the bottom right hand side it says read only.

59
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,090
So let's go back to my dashboard.

60
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,290
And I don't actually have any inline policies at the moment but let's go ahead and create one so if

61
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:21,770
I go to my user and because it's an in non-policy and it is associated with either a user group or role

62
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,600
you have to be in the User Group or role in order to actually create the policy.

63
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,720
So if you go into a user you will see this option here to add an non-policy.

64
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,640
So we're just going to choose a service and we're going to add a policy for Athena and I'm going to

65
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,050
add right access for Athena click on review.

66
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,950
Give it a name

67
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,900
and click on create policy.

68
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,700
And that is my in line policy and it will show here as being an in line policy.

69
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:01,680
And if I want to for example create a new user I'm not going to call my user ropa going to give programmatic

70
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:08,920
access next and I'm going to try and add that in line policy and if I try to search for that policy

71
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:15,430
it doesn't come up in only my customer managed policies come up a filter based on in policies.

72
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,680
I've only have the choice of either the customer managed or the WS managed.

73
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:25,430
So let's take a look at exam tips for the three different types of I am policy.

74
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:33,060
Just remember the managed policy is the AWOS managed default policy like Dynamite's be full access et.

75
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,980
The customer manage policy is one managed by you created by you and managed by you and you can apply

76
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:44,120
it to multiple users groups or rows and the inline policy is managed by you.

77
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,550
But it's embedded in a single user group or row.

78
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:53,410
And there is a one to one relationship between the line policy and the user group or row to which they

79
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,360
are embedded.

80
00:06:54,370 --> 00:07:02,070
And finally in most cases I ws recommends using their own banish'd policies over in line policies.

81
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,600
Well that's the end of this lecture.

82
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,910
If you have any questions please let me know.

83
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,480
If not feel free to move onto the next lecture.

84
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:08,990
Thank you.
