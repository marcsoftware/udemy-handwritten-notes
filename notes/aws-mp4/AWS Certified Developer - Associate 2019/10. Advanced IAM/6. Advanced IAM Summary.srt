Hello and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is the advanced identity access management summary.

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:14,330
So it's the end of this section of the course and it's going to be a summary and exam tips for advance

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,460
identity access management.

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,690
So let's get started.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:24,710
Remember identity Federation allows users to authenticate with a web identity provider.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,540
So I think Google Facebook or Amazon they use the authenticates first with the web I.D. provider.

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:39,250
They then receive an authentication token which is then exchanged for temporary AWOS credentials allowing

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,150
them to assume an identity access management role.

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,820
And the I AM role allows them to access AWOS resources company.

10
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:54,590
So it's an I.T. Poca and it handles the interaction between your applications and the web provider.

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,660
So you don't need to write your own code to do this.

12
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:06,640
It provides sign up sign in and Guest User Access and syncs user data for a seamless experience across

13
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:13,620
multiple devices and company tohe is the recommended approach for web I.T. Federation.

14
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:19,600
So if you see any exam questions asking you which technology to use if you want to authenticate your

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,080
applications against a web identity provider like Facebook Google or Amazon if there's any questions

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,370
around that asking you which is the best technology.

17
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:35,470
Well Coquito is the recommended approach particularly for mobile applications and cognito use is use

18
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:42,520
suppose to manage users sign up and sign in either directly to the user pool or via the web identity

19
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,310
provider.

20
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:52,260
And it uses push synchronization to send a silent push notification via As an as simple notification

21
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,520
service of use updates to multiple device types.

22
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:04,030
So your mobile phone tablet and laptop for example all associated with your user ID.

23
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:12,670
So in our example we had our user authenticating against a user poll which then receives JWT tokens.

24
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,250
So gyse on web tokens from the web.

25
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:23,660
Identity providers like Facebook Google or Amazon the company identity so then exchanges the JWT tokens

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:30,410
for AWOS credentials which enables the user to temporarily access AWOS resources.

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,260
For example S-3 IDB RDX easy to etc..

28
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,050
Moving on to inline policies managed policies and custom policies.

29
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,050
Remember the three different types of I and policy.

30
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:49,170
So we have the managed policy and this is the AWOS managed default policies so the ones that we can

31
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:55,240
search for when we go to create a role or when we want to assign a policy to a user group or row.

32
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:02,240
And these are the policies like Don MIDP full access code deploy full access S-3 full access et cetera.

33
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,520
And these can be assigned to any number of users groups or rows across AWOS the customer manage policy.

34
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,830
So thats for any policy that is not catered for by the managed policy you can create your own and its

35
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,320
managed by you and it can be attached to multiple users groups or rows.

36
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,610
And then finally there's the in line policy and that is managed by you and embedded within a single

37
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,160
user group or.

38
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,980
So it's a one to one mapping between the policy and the entity to which it's embedded.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,230
And when you delete the user group or row the policy is also deleted.

40
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,960
And in most cases I ws recommends using managed policies over inline policies.

41
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,990
So that is the end of this lecture.

42
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,710
And that's the end of the section.

43
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,760
So well done for completing the section if you have any questions please let me know.

44
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,240
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

45
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,940
Thank you.
