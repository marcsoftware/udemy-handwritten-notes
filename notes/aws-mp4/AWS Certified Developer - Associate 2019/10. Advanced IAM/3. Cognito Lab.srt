00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:07,830
Hello Clockers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is going to be a lap and we are going to

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:14,700
be configuring a company to use a pool and we're going to take a look at the built in sign up and sign

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:22,140
in functionality provided by cognito which allows you to manage your users who need to sign into your

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,770
web applications and your mobile applications.

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,510
So if you've got time please join me in the U.S. consul.

6
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:38,730
So here I am in the AWOS consul and you'll find cognito and security identity and compliance.

7
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:45,070
So just click on cognito click on manage user polls and create a usable.

8
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,170
So the first thing we need to do is give it a name and I'm just going to call it test poll.

9
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:56,660
Click on review the votes and we can just keep to all of the defaults that you see here.

10
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,590
And there's various things that you can change and you can configure for yourself things like the password

11
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:08,230
length the policy you can enable multi-factor authentication but we can stick with the defaults.

12
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,050
I'm going to go ahead and click Create pool.

13
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,000
So that has been created successfully.

14
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:22,200
And I'm just going to scroll down to app clients and click on Add app client and the app client is what

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,290
we used to call the various IPs on our behalf.

16
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:32,640
For example the API to register a new user or to sign in a user so click on Add app client and we need

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,080
to give it a name.

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,480
I'm just going to call it my test client.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,860
And once again just stick to the default.

20
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,110
So you should have generate secret selected.

21
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,930
So just click on Create a plant and now we need to configure the app.

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,000
So just click on uptalk settings and we need to enable an identity provider for all application.

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,180
And so just select Kokanee toat use a poll and then next thing we need to do is we need to configure

24
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:07,680
a Colback you Oreilles and a Colback QOL is really is just going to be the you RL that your users are

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,820
going to be redirected to after they have successfully signed in or signed up just for this demo.

26
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,380
We're going to use HTP s Fulwood slash example dot com.

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,030
So it's just going to be a dummy Web site but in reality if you have your own web application you could

28
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,400
use whichever Web site you want your users to land on.

29
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,540
Once they have signed into the application we don't need to configure us you around.

30
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,300
So I'm just going to leave that blank now.

31
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:41,510
And then under the oath to section I'm going to select the first two options.

32
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,930
So authorization code grants so that it's going to configure cognito to give you back an authorization

33
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:54,450
code which you can provide back to your to your backend authorization process and the implicit Graun

34
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,350
but just gives you the JWT token.

35
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,400
So that means when we go to test the configuration we'll be able to view that JWT token and under a

36
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,190
cloud.

37
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,480
Scope's I'm just going to select everything.

38
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,340
So the phone an e-mail that is just for user verification.

39
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,770
So when you first sign it sign up they'll send you an email just to get you to verify your e-mail is

40
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,850
correct.

41
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,770
And then we're going to select these three as well.

42
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:27,140
And if you're not familiar with o'th it is simply an open standard authentication framework and by selecting

43
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:32,930
all of these old scopes this is just going to grant access to the cognito API.

44
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,040
So all of the API operations like the sign in and sign up.

45
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,940
And also it's going to give us access to the JWT token that cognito will return.

46
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,420
You can learn more about the water flows and scopes.

47
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,890
If you click on this link here just open up in a new tab.

48
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,040
And it just takes you straight to the computer documentation so you can read all about that at your

49
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,470
leisure.

50
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,290
But it is out of sight for the exam you do not need to learn it for the exam.

51
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:06,560
So I'm just going to go ahead and click save changes then head over to domain name and we need to create

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,220
a domain prefix for Amazon company type domain and you can just make one up.

53
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,410
I'm just going to call it ICG test.

54
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:19,210
Click on check availability and if it's available then we can go ahead and site changes.

55
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:25,130
And this just applies this domain prefix to the cognito domain that it's creating for you.

56
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:31,220
And then the last thing I'm going to do is you customization so you can customize cognito or the look

57
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,140
and feel of the sign in and sign up page as you want so you can add a logo.

58
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:43,740
You can customize the labels the input fields text descriptions Banas et cetera et cetera.

59
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,440
So I'm just going to add a logo to all sign up page.

60
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,420
I'm just going to add the cloud good logo.

61
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,200
Select that file keep everything else as the default and click save.

62
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,600
So now we have configured everything we need for cognito.

63
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:06,800
So cognito is going to create a built in sign up and sign in page based on our configuration.

64
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,950
So let's test it and see if it's working.

65
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:17,500
So the first thing I'm going to do is go to app integration grab my cognito to my name.

66
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,810
Copy that to a new tab and just paste that.

67
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:27,240
But we need to add a few additional parameters as well in order to test this properly.

68
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:38,750
So I'm just going to type in slash in question mark and then response underscore type it ECOs token

69
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,160
because you want it to respond with a token then ampersand.

70
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:54,140
And clients underscore already equals they're going to come back to cognito go to my client settings

71
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,840
grepped my ID and don't worry.

72
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:02,540
There's quite a lot to type into the browser here but that will all be provided in the resources section

73
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,620
of the course.

74
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:13,110
The next thing we need to do is ampersand and redirect underscore you or I ECOs.

75
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:19,470
I'm just going to copy and paste it from my client's settings to make sure I spell it exactly the same.

76
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,560
You want to make sure this is really the same because if you accidently type it differently it's not

77
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,490
going to work.

78
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,050
And then I'm going to hit enter on if that's worked correctly for you.

79
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,410
This is what you should see.

80
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:38,720
And this is the sign up and sign in page that cognito has created for us and it's all completely in.

81
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,210
We don't have to write any of the code for this.

82
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,290
It's just all based on the options that we configured within all user poll.

83
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,250
And when we set up our app client so we don't have any users yet in on user poll.

84
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,370
So we need to create a new use us.

85
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,910
I'm just going to create a new account and I'm going to call it fe at my email address in Crais a password

86
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:05,300
and you'll see it's making sure that we adhere to the password policy then hit sign up and because we

87
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,120
were selected to send a verification code by email.

88
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,300
So it's going to send a verification code to the email address that I've used to sign up with.

89
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,690
So I'm just going to go and check my e-mail now.

90
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,040
And there's my e-mail with my verification codes just going to keep it up.

91
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,580
Come back to my site in page paste in the verification code and click confirm account.

92
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,790
So there we are we've signed in and it's taken me to the test domain the example to mine.

93
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:37,040
And if you look at the top of your browser you'll see the I.D. tokens are the JWT token that cognito

94
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,590
has generated for you.

95
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,740
Now if we go back to our use the pools go into users and groups hit refresh.

96
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,440
You should see the user that we just created and we think Kokanee you can also set up groups as well.

97
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,960
So you can go and you can create a group and you can also select an identity access management role

98
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,410
as well.

99
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:04,160
So for example you could select a role to give access to S-3 create that group and then you could actually

100
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,180
add users in.

101
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,150
So you can add your company to users into that group.

102
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:17,550
So you can actually build out groups of users within your cognito directory and you can assign them

103
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,130
an identity access management role associated with a specific cognito group.

104
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:29,910
So these roles can then be used to access AWOS services like files in S-3 dynamite Eby tables that kind

105
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,540
of thing.

106
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:36,210
And if we move down to Federation and click on identity providers you'll find the different identity

107
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,320
providers the cognito confederate with on your behalf as well.

108
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:47,430
So you've got Facebook Google Amazon Sammul which refers to any small compliant directories that could

109
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:53,670
be active directory for example and also open ID and configuring all of this is really beyond the scope

110
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,630
of the exam.

111
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,590
The main thing you really need to know is what is cognito a high level.

112
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:04,760
So just remember it allows you to manage user identity for your mobile and web applications integrates

113
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,480
with Facebook Google Amazon and other identity providers.

114
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:14,110
And is the recommended approach for users sign up and sign in for mobile applications.

115
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,860
So that is the end of this lab.

116
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,530
If you'd like to delete all of your cognito sets up the first thing you need to do is delete your domain.

117
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,820
So just go ahead and delete that domain.

118
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,320
And then once you've done that it will allow you to go to general settings and then you can delete your

119
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,520
pool as well.

120
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,730
So that's the end of this lecture.

121
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,840
If you have any questions please let me know.

122
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,120
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

123
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:35,690
Thank ye.
