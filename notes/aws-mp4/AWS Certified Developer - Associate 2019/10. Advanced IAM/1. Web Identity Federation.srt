00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:06,780
Hello Clockers and welcome to this section of the course and this section is all about advanced identity

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:12,520
axis management and we're going to start with web identity Federation.

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,800
So what is web identity Federation.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:22,470
Well it lets you give your users access to AWOS resources after they have successfully authenticated

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,120
with a web based identity provider like Amazon Facebook or Google.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:35,440
Following successful authentication the user receives an authentication code from the web I.T. provider

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:43,900
which they can then trade for temporary AWOS security credentials which will then allow them to access

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,760
I ws resources.

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,940
So for example imagine that you are developing a web based application and you want to make it available

10
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,100
to Facebook uses.

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,920
You can actually use web identity Federation to handle the authentication of the users on your behalf

12
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:06,820
and may provide the service called Amazon cognito which enables web identity Federation with the following

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,020
features.

14
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,090
Firstly it gives you sign up and sign in to your applications.

15
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,460
It provides access for guest visas.

16
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,120
So it enables you to handle users who don't already have an account.

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,560
It acts as an identity broker between your application and web I.D. providers.

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,240
And that means you don't need to write any special code to integrate your application.

19
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:35,230
And the web identity provider it synchronizes use that data across multiple devices.

20
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:42,190
So for example if I access an application using my mobile phone I could change to my use data or my

21
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,620
profile data.

22
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:50,080
Next time I log into the same application and I'm using a tablet or a PC I should see the updates that

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,780
I made for my mobile phone.

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,840
So you should get a seamless experience across all different devices.

25
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:04,960
And finally cognito is recommended for all mobile applications which run on IWM services and cognito

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:12,250
is the recommended approach for weap identity Federation using social media accounts like Facebook Google

27
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,220
and also Amazon as well.

28
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:21,850
So just imagine a mobile shopping application and it's using S3 for product data and Dynamo IDB for

29
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:28,300
customer data and you want to enable customers to log in using Facebook and then to be able to access

30
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,670
the product data on their own profile data within the customer database.

31
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:39,550
So first of all they'll need to look into Facebook and after successfully logging into Facebook Facebook

32
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:46,090
will give them a web token and cognito it will take the Web token and exchange it for temporary AWOS

33
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,010
credentials.

34
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,670
And it's these temporary credentials which allow them the access that they need to see the contents

35
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,040
of your three pocket and also to request an update data in the database.

36
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:02,290
So a company toke brokerage between the application and Facebook or Google to provide these temporary

37
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:08,610
credentials and then it's these credentials which map to an identity access management role and its

38
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,640
role allows them access to the required resources.

39
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:19,030
So this means that there's no need for the application to embed any ws credentials and you don't need

40
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,810
to store credentials locally on the device on the mobile phone or the tablet.

41
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:30,250
And another benefit of cognito is that it can also give users a really seamless experience across all

42
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,460
mobile devices.

43
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:37,900
So you can logon using multiple different devices and you should get the same user experience no matter

44
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,620
what device you are using.

45
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:45,090
So let's take a look at some of our exam tips for web identity Federation.

46
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:52,240
Remember Federation allows users to authenticate with a web identity provider like Google Facebook or

47
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,360
Amazon.

48
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,030
They use a authenticates first with the web I.D. provider.

49
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:04,000
They then receive the authentication token which gets exchanged for temporary AWOS credentials allow

50
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:10,110
them to receive an identity crisis management low Kokanee to an identity Broca.

51
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,070
It handles the interaction between your applications and the web I.D. provider and you don't need to

52
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,990
buy any of your own code in order to do this.

53
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:24,850
It provides sign up sign in and guest user access sinks they use the data for a seamless experience

54
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:32,560
across all your devices and Kokanee is the AWOS recommended approach for web I.D. Federation particularly

55
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,140
for mobile applications.

56
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,980
So that's the end of this lecture.

57
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,880
If you have any questions please let me know.

58
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,530
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

59
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,130
Thank you.
