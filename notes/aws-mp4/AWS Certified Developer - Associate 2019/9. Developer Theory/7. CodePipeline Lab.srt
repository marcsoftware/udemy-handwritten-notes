00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,840
Hello packers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is going to be a code pipeline lab and this

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,900
lab is actually going to be in three different stages.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,220
So first of all we're going to use cloud formation to create an easy to instance.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,360
We're going to upload version 1 of our application into an S3 Buckets and then we're going to deploy

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,440
our application to our easy to instance using code deploy.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,780
Then in the next stage we're going to build a code pipeline and manually trigger code deploy it to update

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,660
our application to version 2 and then finally we are going to configure an automated pipeline which

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,800
is going to be triggered when we add a new version of our code to the S3 bucket.

9
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:47,730
So that's automatically going to trigger a cloud watch event which is going to trigger code pipeline

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,290
to redeploy the code to our easy to instance using code deploy.

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,290
So without further ado let's get started.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,450
Now the first thing I want to show you is that there are a load of resources provided for this lecture.

13
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,820
So firstly we have a text file which contains all of the cloud formation commands.

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,480
So these are the commands that we're going to use to create or easy to instance.

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,480
And there is also this code revisions zip file and when you unzip it it's going to create three different

16
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,520
directories.

17
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,510
And that's going to be for three different versions of the web application that we're going to install.

18
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:26,820
So if I go into the first directory we've got our aspect of Yammer which you should be familiar with

19
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,290
already.

20
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:33,760
If you've already done code deploy lab we have an index to HMO which is the web page for our web application.

21
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,800
We have a scripts directory which contains three different scripts.

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,970
So there's an install dependency script.

23
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,680
So code deploy is going to go in and install H2 TPD.

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,910
Then we have a script to start H2 DPD and to stop it as well.

25
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,340
And these are all contained in this my web app dot Zip.

26
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,920
And that folder structure is reflected in each of these three different directories.

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,200
So when you download the zip file and it creates these directories for you you don't need to unzip my

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,740
web app does it because that's what we're going to be uploading into code deploy.

29
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,940
So just keep that folder structure exactly as you see it on my screen.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,260
The first thing we're going to do is we're going to come to our cloud formation commands and we're going

31
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:20,100
to create our instance using cloud formation and I've provided the cloud formation template view to

32
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,880
use.

33
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,360
And it's in the resources section of the course and all it does is launch an easy to instance with the

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,860
code deploy agent already installed as well as the identity access management permissions and the security

35
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,380
groups you're going to need as well.

36
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,360
So it's a really quick way of setting up our instance so that we can just get on with the fun part of

37
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,670
the lab which is configuring code deploy and code pipeline and don't worry if you haven't used cloud

38
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,380
formation before we have a lab coming up later on in the course where we're going to be going through

39
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,340
it in a lot more detail.

40
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,130
So for now the first thing that you need to do is download the cloud formation template and I'm just

41
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,980
going to show you the template now just to show you exactly what it's doing.

42
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,990
So basically it creates your easy to instance and it allows you to tag your instance so that you can

43
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:17,340
easily identify it later on when we come to use the code deploy it also Associates an existing SSA each

44
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,850
key pad name as well and it sets up a security group which will allow you to log onto the easy to instance

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,390
once it has been launched.

46
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,540
And if we scroll down here to the mapping section you'll see that this template is going to allow you

47
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,380
to launch instances in one of these four regions.

48
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:40,740
So you have a choice of either U.S. East 1 U.S. West to EU West one or AP southeast too.

49
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,060
So for this particular lab you can only work in one of these four regions.

50
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,080
So pick the region that you want to work in and just make sure that everything that you do within this

51
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,150
lab is done in the same region that you select.

52
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:58,170
Now in order to use this cloud formation template we're going to need to store it in an S3 bucket because

53
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,950
cloud formation always sources its templates from S3.

54
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:08,100
So I'm going to return it to the console come to services and click on S3 and I'm going to create a

55
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:15,000
new bucket and I'm going to call it C F templates hyphen fe check the region is where I want to be working

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,800
so it's I'm working in EU Ireland and hit create.

57
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,390
So there's a bucket so just click on the bucket hit upload and we're going to add our cloud formation

58
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,580
template into this bucket.

59
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,200
So hit ad files select the template and hit open and upload.

60
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,580
So once we've done that we need to run the cloud formation command.

61
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,170
So I'm going to come back to my commands and here is the command that we need to run but there's just

62
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,320
a couple of things that you're going to need to change on your side.

63
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,850
So first of all we need to provide the template you are all.

64
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,990
And this is going to be the you are all of the file that we've just uploaded to S3 so you'll need to

65
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,440
change the region to the correct region and you'll also need to specify the correct bucket name as well.

66
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,420
And then the second thing that you're going to need to change is this key pair value.

67
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,750
And this is going to be the name of a key player located in the region that you're working.

68
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,500
So I've added the key pen name of my key player in Ireland.

69
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,970
And if you haven't got a key pair created you can simply go into easy to make sure you're in the correct

70
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,420
region.

71
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:23,690
So I'm in Ireland click on key pairs you can see I've got two key pairs there but if I didn't have any

72
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,530
I could just go in and create one.

73
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,440
Make sure you download it to your local machine and remember to set the permissions so that only you

74
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,250
can read it.

75
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,410
And before you can run any of these commands you do need to make sure that you have run a W as configure

76
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,400
on your local machine and in the previous lab in the code deploy lab.

77
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,570
If you've already done that lab you will have already configured your NWS come online interface.

78
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,960
And if you remember we used the credentials of an identity access management user called CDO user.

79
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,580
And if you haven't done that lab then definitely do go back and do it before attempting this one.

80
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,950
And I just have a couple of really cool commands that you can run right now to verify your setup.

81
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:08,360
So here I am in the terminal and the first thing I'm going to run is a W as I am get hyphen user and

82
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,160
I love this command.

83
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,300
It just tells you which user you have used to configure your AWP command line with.

84
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,720
So in my case mine is set up with CDO user.

85
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,080
And if you're just on the previous lab you should be as well.

86
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,960
And then the second come out I'm going to run is a W.S. configure list and this is going to tell you

87
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:32,180
how you set up your command line and the main thing I'm interested in here is what region I am configured

88
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,130
to be using.

89
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,570
So I'm configured to use EU W1 but if you're not in the region that you want to be in then all you need

90
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:45,590
to do is just run NWS configure and you can just go in and change the values and you can change your

91
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,590
default region there to match the one that you want to be working in.

92
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,760
So my command line is set up using the credentials of this CDO user.

93
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:59,450
And in order for that user to use cloud formation to launch 82 instances and also create security groups

94
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,880
we're going to need to add some additional permissions for our user.

95
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,100
So I'm gonna show you how to do that right now.

96
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,520
So if you come back to the W S console and I'm just going to come down to identity access management

97
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:17,420
go to users I'm gonna find my user and looking at this user they already have S3 full access and I also

98
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,700
have code deploy full access but they're going to need some additional permissions.

99
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:29,270
So in order to do that I'm going to create a new policy so come to policies create policy select Jason.

100
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,130
And I've already prepared the Jason code for this policy and you'll find it in the resources section

101
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,000
of the course.

102
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,250
So here is our code for our new policy.

103
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:43,190
So it's going to allow access to cloud formation identity access management and easy to as well.

104
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,510
And this is going to give our user permission to create or easy to instances.

105
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,770
So I'm just going to copy that.

106
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:53,570
Come back to the console paste that in the Jason editor click review and I'm gonna give it a name.

107
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,730
I'm just gonna call it C F access and then click on create policy.

108
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,600
So that is our policy created and we just need to go back and attach it to our user.

109
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:08,610
So come back to see user ads permissions attach existing policies directly and we're going to filter

110
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,500
out policies on customer managed and then just search for the EFF.

111
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,750
And there is ICF access policy.

112
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,570
So then click on review and add permissions.

113
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,770
So now we are good to go to use cloud formation to create our instance.

114
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:27,620
So once you've done that you can just copy that command and you'll notice here these backslash is these

115
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,780
just give you a line continuation just to make the command a lot easier to read if you're working on

116
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,830
Windows you're going to need to use this character here to denote the line continuation.

117
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:43,580
So just substitute these backlashes for don't know what these characters called it looks like a little

118
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,120
hat but you get it by entering shift and 6 at the same time.

119
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:52,370
So I'm just going to copy that command post it into my terminal window and hit enter and because cloud

120
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:58,400
formation has got quite a few things to configure it can take a few minutes to complete but I'm just

121
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,950
going to show you another command which will allow you to check the status of the cloud formation command.

122
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:09,830
So just come back to our commands file and it's this one is just going to verify the status of your

123
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,180
cloud formation command.

124
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,510
So at the moment we can see that it's in progress.

125
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,170
So I'm just going to give it a few minutes to complete and then I'm gonna come back and check again.

126
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:23,510
So while that is working I'm going to come back to the console and create my S3 bucket so come back

127
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:32,000
to services go into S3 hit create bucket and I'm going to call my bucket C.P. bucket dash fe I'm going

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,200
to make sure that it's in the region of Ireland because everything in this lab it needs to be in the

129
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,090
same region if it's not in the same region it's not going to work so hit next.

130
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:46,550
And we need to configure versioning on this bucket because ultimately we want code pipeline to notice

131
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,410
when a new version of our source code appears in the bucket and then we can accept all the rest of the

132
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,120
defaults.

133
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,060
So next.

134
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,770
Next and create bucket.

135
00:09:54,890 --> 00:10:00,410
So that's a bucket created to go into the bucket and we're going to upload version one of our application

136
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:06,020
so click upload add files and you'll need to navigate to version one of our application.

137
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:12,240
So it's this folder and grab the file called my web app dot zip and it must be the zip file it can't

138
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:18,200
be the individual files so click on open and upload and I'm not going to go back to the terminal window

139
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,200
and see if cloud formations stack has completed.

140
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,610
So I'm just gonna hit up arrow to repeat our previous command and hit enter and hopefully it should

141
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,940
say create complete.

142
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,260
If that has been successful.

143
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,450
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to try and look into that instance to make sure that

144
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,350
the code deploy agent has been installed successfully.

145
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:44,160
So I'm going to come back into my NWS console go to services to make sure I'm in the right region Ireland

146
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:50,640
click on running instances select my instance and copy our public IP address from down here I'm then

147
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,850
going to change directory to the directory where my private key is safe.

148
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,990
Mine's in downloads and then I'm gonna run SS H minus I.

149
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,720
And then the name of my key pair and then AC to dash user at.

150
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,120
And then I'm gonna paste the IP address of my easy to instance top.

151
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,780
Yes.

152
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,710
And then we are our easy to instance just.

153
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,830
I'm just gonna hit clear.

154
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,310
And then there's one come on that we just need to run on here to check that the code deploy agent has

155
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,590
been correctly installed.

156
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,220
So just copy that and paste and we can see that the code deploy agent has been installed and it is running.

157
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,490
So the next thing we need to do is configure code deploy to deploy our application using the code that

158
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:34,120
we just uploaded to the S3 bucket so come back to the console and we need to go to services and come

159
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,570
down to develop tools and hit code deploy.

160
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,100
And the easiest way to do it is just just go to get started.

161
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,590
Make sure you are in the same region that you've been working with the whole time so I'm in Ireland.

162
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,350
Click on Create application.

163
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:54,010
So I'm just going to call it my web app select the compute platform that's going to be easy to and click

164
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,270
Create application.

165
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,860
So the next thing we need to do is create our deployment group.

166
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,080
And this is going to define the instance where we're going to run our deployment.

167
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,360
So I'm just going to click on Create deployment group.

168
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,040
I'm going to call it my DG.

169
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,850
And if you've already done my code deploy lab you will already have an appropriate service role that

170
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,540
you can use.

171
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,640
So just click on CDE service role.

172
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,920
That's the one that we created in the previous lab for deployment type.

173
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,010
It's only one instance.

174
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,640
So we're just gonna use an in-place deployment for environment configuration is just going to be easy

175
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,690
to instances.

176
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,280
And this is where we need to define which easy two instances are going to be part of this deployment

177
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,730
group.

178
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,910
So we need to find the tag that was attached to our easy to instance.

179
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:37,060
So I'm just going to go up to services and open that in a new tab come back to easy to find my instance.

180
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:42,040
Go to the tags and it has a tag which is called name and the name is code.

181
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,880
Deploy demo spelt like that.

182
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,160
I'm just going to copy that.

183
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:51,010
Come back to my code deploy console and the tag is going to be name and the value that is found it for

184
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:51,370
me.

185
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:56,110
It might find it for you or you might need to paste it in but it should be code deploy it demo then

186
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,000
scroll down.

187
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,770
We're not going to be using a load balancer.

188
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,340
So uncheck that and then create deployment group.

189
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,450
So that is our deployment group created.

190
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,810
So the next thing we need to do is click on Create deployment select your deployment group that you

191
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,620
just created under revision.

192
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,350
You're going to need to provide the S3 location where we uploaded the web app zip.

193
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,020
So it's going to be S3.

194
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:23,430
Then the name of your bucket and then the name of the file which is my wife zip and click Create deployments.

195
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,240
So that might take a few minutes to complete.

196
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,890
So it's going to go in uninstall 80 TPD and copy across our index or HDMI.

197
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,410
So none of that has succeeded and we can test it by going back to our easy to console grabbing the public

198
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,800
IP of our instance.

199
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,340
I'm going to open a new browser tab and just paste that into the browser.

200
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:40,900
And there we are.

201
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,740
That's Virgin One of our application installed using code deploy.

202
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,730
So far so good.

203
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,300
So the next thing we need to do is configure the code pipeline.

204
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,780
So first of all we're going to use code pipeline to manually deploy a new version of our application.

205
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,620
So the first thing I'm going to do is update the code in my S3 Buckets with the next version.

206
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,670
So come back to the console go to services S3.

207
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,710
Go to our bucket.

208
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,160
Now we can't delete this old version because we have version control enabled on our bucket.

209
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,820
So I'm just gonna go ahead and upload the next version of our code.

210
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:20,080
So go to upload ad files and I'm going to go into my virgin to directory and grab all zip file.

211
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,670
So it's our version to directory my web app dot zip click open and upload.

212
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,520
And if we hit the show button next to versions it will show or two different versions of the file.

213
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:34,740
So now I'm gonna go back to my code deploy tab and you'll find a code pipeline under developer tools.

214
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,750
And it's on the left hand side underneath.

215
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,800
Code deploy so we can just go straight into code pipeline from here and I'm going to click on Getting

216
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,770
Started click on Create pipeline give it a name.

217
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,900
I'm just gonna call it my pipeline and underneath surface roll you can either have code pipeline create

218
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,760
a new service roll in your account which will give it access to everything that it needs to do you can

219
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,290
use an existing service role if you already have one but I'm just going to stick to the default and

220
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,540
let it create a new service role for us.

221
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,190
So keep to the rest of the defaults and hit next.

222
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,370
And we now need to provide a source provider.

223
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,070
So this is where our application source code is located and all is going to be in S3 we select the bucket

224
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:17,710
where we've stored our code and we also need to provide the name of the file under detection options.

225
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:23,110
So the recommended option is so allow our cloud watch events to automatically start your pipeline when

226
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,930
a change occurs to the source code contained in our S3 bucket.

227
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,730
So I'm just gonna keep that to the default pit next under built provider.

228
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,520
You can actually integrate code pipeline with a W S code build and Jenkins as well if you're actually

229
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,640
building code as part of the pipeline.

230
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:43,690
But in this example we're not doing that so I'm just going to click Skip build stage and then for deployment

231
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,840
provider this is going to be code deploy.

232
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,740
Make sure our region is the correct region.

233
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:53,650
The name of our application is my web app the deployment group is my DG hit next reviewed the settings

234
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:59,800
and if you're happy with those settings create line and there's our pipeline and it does take a few

235
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,070
minutes to complete.

236
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:06,780
So I'm just going to pause the video now and come back when that is complete so that is complete and

237
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,670
the deployment has succeeded.

238
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,310
And I did actually end up having to retry the command.

239
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,350
I think what happened was it just took a little bit longer to create the service role and then the command

240
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,220
ended up failing.

241
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,180
So they do give you a retry button if that does happen.

242
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,700
Just be aware in case you do see it fail the very first time you run this.

243
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,910
So we've manually triggered our deployment using code pipeline.

244
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,920
So let's go back to our Web page and refresh and see if we've got version two of our application.

245
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,170
So I'm just gonna hit reload and there is version 2 which we have deployed manually using code pipeline.

246
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,750
So now we get to do the fun bit.

247
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,480
So we're going to upload the final version of our web applications S3.

248
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,850
And if it's all working properly then code pipeline should automatically run a new deployment and it

249
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,490
will deploy the new version to our instance without us having to manually trigger the build.

250
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,630
So I'm going to come back to my S3 console and I'm gonna upload the next version of the application.

251
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,660
Click on ADD files and then you'll need to navigate to our version 3 directory and grab the my web app

252
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:09,510
top zip from that directory click open and upload and then straightaway we need to come back to code

253
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:15,120
pipeline and you can see straightaway it's detected that there has been a change in our S3 bucket.

254
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:20,460
So it's kicked off a new pipeline and it's triggered code deployed to begin the new deployment.

255
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,340
So that has succeeded and we can go ahead and test that.

256
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,720
If we go back to our browser window with the application hit refresh and there we are.

257
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,880
That's version 3 of our application We've uploaded our new version of the source code and that has triggered

258
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,850
the automatic deployment using code pipeline.

259
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,930
So that is everything that I wanted to show you about code pipeline and if you want to go in and delete

260
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,960
everything you can go into edit and delete.

261
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,660
And then also remember to go into cloud formation and delete your cloud formation stack as well so that

262
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,460
you don't get charged unnecessarily.

263
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,550
If you have any questions please let me know.

264
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,900
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

265
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,440
Thank you.
