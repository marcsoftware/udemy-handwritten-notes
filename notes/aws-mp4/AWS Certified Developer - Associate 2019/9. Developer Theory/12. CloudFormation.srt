00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,090
Hello Cocker's and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is all about cloud formation.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,230
So let's get started now.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,570
Confirmation it's a service that allows you to manage configure and provision your AWOS infrastructure

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,290
as code and resources are the resources that you're going to provision are defined.

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:28,720
Using a cloud formation template and that is the code element and cloud formation.

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,390
It takes that templates.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,810
It interprets it and makes the appropriate API calls in order to create the resources that you have

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:43,960
defined in the template and the template supports either YAML or Jason.

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,440
So you can use either YAML or Jason.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,710
Which ever you're comfortable with to create your cloud formation templates.

11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,830
So what are some of the benefits of cloud formation.

12
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:00,490
Well firstly it allows you to provision your infrastructure in a really consistent way.

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:07,720
So it's the same every single time there's fewer mistakes because there's less opportunity for human

14
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,010
error.

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,340
It takes less time and effort than it would if you were to configure things manually.

16
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,480
You can also version control and peer review templates and it's free to use.

17
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,020
However you will be charged for any resources that you create.

18
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:33,790
It can be used to manage updates to existing cloud formation platforms and it can also handle dependencies

19
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:40,780
between different resources to ensure that resources are created in the correct order and it can also

20
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:47,180
be used to really quickly and easily roll back and delete the entire stack that you've created with

21
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,810
income formation as well.

22
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:55,480
So it's really easy to clear up environments that were temporary or just being used to test something

23
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,260
you can really quickly have cloud formation roll back and delete the whole lot for you as well.

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,840
So let's look at the cloud formation template in a little bit more detail.

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,090
So once again you can use either Jamo or Jasen to describe the end state of the infrastructure that

26
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,810
you are either provisioning or changing.

27
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,360
Once you've created the template you upload it to cloud formation using S3.

28
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:28,960
So within the cloud formation console you actually upload it and ends up in an S3 bucket and then cloud

29
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,710
formation accesses the template within the S3 bucket.

30
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:39,130
It reads the template and then it makes the appropriate API calls on your behalf to create the resources

31
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:46,750
for you and the resulting resources are referred to as a stack and it's called a cloud formation stack.

32
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:53,290
So let's have a look at an example cloud formation templates and most of these options or parameters

33
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,460
are optional.

34
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,440
It's only really the resources section that we'll see in the next slide that is mandatory.

35
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,160
So everything else that you can see on this page is optional.

36
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:11,050
So firstly First of all we have the template formas version and the only supported version is 2010 0

37
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,230
9 0 9 and that just refers to the version of the template format.

38
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,310
So the acceptable the supported template format for the cloud formation template.

39
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,830
Moving on we have the description and of course this is optional.

40
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,210
So you can just add in a description of your choice something meaningful to you.

41
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:35,260
So in this case it's just describing this as a template to create an easy to instance.

42
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,190
Next is meta data and that is simply data about data.

43
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,270
Once again it's completely optional.

44
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,280
So you can just put in a custom field and for this one we're just providing some data about the specific

45
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,970
instances that this confirmation template is going to provision.

46
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,730
So just give us a description of web server instance moving down to parameters.

47
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:03,580
So these saw input values that you actually input to cloud formation when you actually go ahead and

48
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,890
launch a stack using this template.

49
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:12,090
So this is information that you need to provide when you go ahead and launch this stack.

50
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:18,250
And in this case we're defining some environment an environment type and the allowed values are either

51
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,140
prod or test.

52
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:25,630
So we need to provide that when we actually go ahead and launch a stack using this template.

53
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,730
And then the next Prometa is conditions and we can use this and we can use conditions.

54
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:37,240
Once again it's completely user defined and we can actually use this to test a condition and take action

55
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,810
based on the outcome of testing that condition.

56
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:47,560
So in this case we are evaluating the parameter and type which was declared in the previous section

57
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,390
under the premises section.

58
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:56,620
So we're evaluating that and we're saying if it ECOs to prod then we should create poured resources

59
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:04,070
only so you can use it to tell color formation to make decisions based on parameters that you have input.

60
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:12,400
At lunchtime so moving on to mappings and we can use mappings to set our own user defined families.

61
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,240
So for example we could set the value of an AM I based on a region so we can completely define this

62
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,930
ourself.

63
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:26,240
So for example the EU west one that is the I AM Are we going to use and you could define different am

64
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,460
I.

65
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:33,550
For every different region you could define a different for different environments etc. etc. it's all

66
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,100
very flexible and completely user defined.

67
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,880
The next section called transform.

68
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:45,170
This is quite important because this allows you to actually include snippets of code which are outside

69
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,720
the main template.

70
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,000
Now you can either include for example code for a lambda function.

71
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,860
You could include your own code.

72
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,620
You want to reuse.

73
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,460
There's also a lot of code snippets which I ws provides.

74
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,310
And I'm just going to show you the web page where you can find these.

75
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:08,760
So I'm just going to search for cloud formation snippets and there's a whole load of different exam

76
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,620
scenarios that you can use to allow you to declare various different cloud formation template pods.

77
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:24,780
So for example as templates sandpits the dynamite be so easy to elastic container service audience 3:53

78
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,200
etc etc..

79
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,330
Loew's there's all sorts of different resources that I have provided example code for.

80
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:38,370
So for example if we take a look at the don't do IDB one at Scott is an example piece of code for creating

81
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,140
a dynamo IDB table the various different properties and attributes.

82
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:50,500
Global secondary indexes provision throughput etc. all the different things you need to define for Adani

83
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,040
IDB table and this example here is in gyse on.

84
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,030
But they also show you it in YAML as well.

85
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:03,570
So you could actually create reusable pieces of code which you can store in S3 and cloud formation will

86
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,600
allow you to actually reference that with in your cloud formation template.

87
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,450
So once again it just allows you to reuse code and maintain consistency throughout your code base.

88
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,300
Then moving on to the resources section.

89
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,220
So this section of the file is the most important.

90
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:26,560
And this is where you define the AWOS resources that you want cloud formation to deploy for.

91
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,800
So in this case we're going to be deploying an AC to instance.

92
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,280
We're defining the instance type as a T-2 micro.

93
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:39,310
And we're also specifying which IMO we want to use as well.

94
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:44,010
And finally the last section of this example template is the output section.

95
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:50,130
And again this is completely use the defined and in this particular template it gets you to output the

96
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,740
instance ID of the SE to instance that we are provisioning and the outputs.

97
00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:01,380
You can see them displayed in the console and they can also be input into another cloud formation stack

98
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,310
as well.

99
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,820
And you don't need to know the template of by heart.

100
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,450
It's unlikely that they're going to ask you really detailed questions about it in the exam but it's

101
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:15,480
important to understand OK what is the anatomy of a cloud formation template what with all the different

102
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,270
sections are used for.

103
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,700
And remember that the resources section is the most important section and it's the only mandatory section

104
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,760
of the template.

105
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:30,750
And also remember that the transform section that is what is used to reference additional code stored

106
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,850
in S3.

107
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:40,890
It allows for code reuse for example you can specify lambda code and also template snippets or reusable

108
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,460
pieces of cloud formation code.

109
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,310
So let's take a look at some bar exam tips for cloud formation.

110
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:55,630
So a confirmation allows you to manage configure and provision AWOS infrastructure as code.

111
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:03,590
And remember we use either YAML or Jasen for the cloud formation template file and remember the main

112
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,500
sections of the cloud formation template.

113
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:13,280
So we have parameters which allows you to input custom values and in the example we use an environment

114
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,060
type.

115
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:19,370
So in that example transformation will expect to to state which environment the resources are going

116
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:26,710
to be for for example production or test conditions used to make decisions based on a set of parameters.

117
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,590
For example it will allow you to provision resources based on environment.

118
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,010
If you've used an environment term into the resources section remember that's the mandatory section

119
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,680
and defines all the AWOS resources to create.

120
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,910
And that could be an S3 bucket.

121
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,790
You see two instances an audio database dynamo DB database.

122
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:54,470
Pretty much anything that you can think of within J-ws you can create as a resource using cloud formation

123
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:01,840
mappings allow you to create custom mappings for example mapping a different am I to a different region.

124
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:07,590
So depending on which region you are working in you can tell cloud formation to use specific I might

125
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,740
add that region.

126
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,560
And finally transforms.

127
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:18,080
So this allows you to reference code located in S3 for example lambda code or reusable snippets of cloud

128
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,390
formation code.

129
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,980
Both of those located in S3.

130
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:27,890
However the best way to learn information is definitely to start using it and get your hands dirty with

131
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,420
it.

132
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,960
And that is exactly what we're going to be doing in the next lecture.

133
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,630
So the next lecture is going to be a lab.

134
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,920
So if we have time please join me in the next lecture.

135
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,480
Thank you.
