00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,300
Helicopters and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is going to be about the service application

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,510
model and it's also called Sam.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,210
So what is some.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,820
Well it's an extension to cloud formation and it's used specifically to define service applications.

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,270
And it gives you a simplified syntax for defining these sedulous resources.

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:34,570
So for example be that API is lambda functions dynamo Debby's etc. and it also has its own command line

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,870
interface called the Sam say ally.

8
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,270
And that's what we use to package the deployment code.

9
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:47,080
Upload it to S-3 so that it can be deployed and then deploy the service applications using cloud formation

10
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,700
and with the CLID you get a couple of different commands.

11
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:58,240
So the first is called Sam package and this command takes a template a Jamo template as its inputs and

12
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:06,140
outputs some compatible templates and uploads a deployment package to an S3 bucket that you specify.

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,060
So that is the first command to package up your deployment packages.

14
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:19,370
And then the second command is some deploy and some deploy takes as input the same template that you've

15
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,910
just created in the previous command.

16
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,150
It specifies the name of your cloud formation stack.

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:32,120
So in this example the stack is going to be called my stack and then the final parameter that goes into

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,740
that command is this capabilities parameter.

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:44,510
And this enables cloud formation to create an I am low on your behalf to allow the function to execute.

20
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:50,110
Now those are the main things that you need to know and understand about some for the exam.

21
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,730
So let's take a look at some of our exam tips.

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,450
So you need to know that Sam is the service application model and it's an extension to cloud formation

23
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:06,260
and it allows you to define a provision Cephalus applications using cloud formation.

24
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:13,580
It has its own CLIA and its own commands to enable you to package and deploy your code.

25
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:20,770
So the first is some package which packages your application and uploads a deployment file to S-3 and

26
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:27,160
then the second one is some deploy which deploys your service applications using confirmation.

27
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,890
But the best way to learn this really is to actually see it in action and that is what we're going to

28
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,830
do next.

29
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,900
So we're going to have a really quick Sam lab where we're going to use some to deploy a small lambda

30
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,960
function using cloud formation.

31
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,500
So if you have any questions please let me know.

32
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,300
If not feel free to join me in the next lecture.

33
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,670
Thank you.
