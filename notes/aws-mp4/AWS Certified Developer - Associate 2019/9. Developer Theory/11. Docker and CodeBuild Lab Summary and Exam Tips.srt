Hello truckers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is going to be a doctor and code build lab

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,420
summary as well as our exam tips.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,910
And if you remember in the previous lab we started off with our Docker file and we manually built a

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:21,000
Docker image and then ran the manual commands to push the image to the elastic container registry and

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,600
then we used a plastic container service to launch the docker container using the image in the registry.

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,000
We then created a source code repository in code commit.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,640
We added our Docker file as well as our build spec camel file which contained all the manual commands

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,510
to build tag and push the Docker image into the plastic container registry and we then used code build

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,720
to build out our image and we pushed the image to the elastic container registry and we saw the new

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,860
image appear in the plastic container registry.

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,840
So let's move onto some of our exam tips for this lab.

12
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:03,270
Well firstly the docker commands to build tag and push your Docker image to the R repository.

13
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,780
These are really important commands to understand and remember the first one we have is docker build

14
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,700
and that just builds your Docker image for you based on your Docker file.

15
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:21,510
We then have this doc Docker target command which applies an alias to your Docker image and in preparation

16
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,910
for pushing it into your repository.

17
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,780
So in this case it applies a tag called latest.

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,660
And then finally we have the docker push command and this simply pushes your Docker image into your

19
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,010
ISA or Docker repository.

20
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,730
Remember that we use the build spectre Jamil to define all the build commands and settings used by code

21
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,220
build to run your build.

22
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,420
You can override the settings in the bills backed or Yammer by adding your own commands in the console

23
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,880
when you launch the build.

24
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,980
And finally if your build fails check the build logs within the code build console and you can also

25
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,100
view the full code build log in cloud watch.

26
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,830
So that is the end of this lecture.

27
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,490
If you have any questions please let me know.

28
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,970
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

29
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,630
Thank you.
