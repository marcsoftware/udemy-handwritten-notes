Like hookers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is all about cloud formation nested stack.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,500
Now there's a whole load of documentation related to best practices for cloud formation.

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:20,850
But the main thing that you need to be aware of for the exam is nested stacks and stacks of stocks that

4
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:28,020
create other stacks within cloud formation and they allow you to use your information code for common

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,160
use cases.

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,080
So for example a standard configuration for lied about on the web server or application server etc..

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,270
So if you have a load balancer configuration that you use again and again in your environments you can

8
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,210
create a dedicated template for a light balancer and then instead of copying and pasting the config

9
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:53,640
every time you want to reuse that code you can store it in its own cloud formation template and then

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,540
reference it from within another cloud formation template.

11
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,270
So it is a template within a template.

12
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:06,540
So let's take a look at the cloud formation Template structure for nested stacks and nested stacks are

13
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,990
declared within the resources section of the cloud formation template and it's going to be of type AWOS

14
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:20,400
cloud formation stack on the properties of the supported properties or notification i o n which you

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,850
can use to define an existing Asinus topic when notifications about stock events can be sent.

16
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,120
The parameter section is for parameters that you want to pass to cloud formation when the nested stack

17
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:41,070
is created and you can add tags as well to describe your stack and the template you RL is the most important

18
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,010
bits.

19
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,730
And this is mandatory and this is the you are l of the template which specifies the nested stack that

20
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:53,470
you want to create and it must be a file located in an Amazon S3 bucket.

21
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,520
And finally you can optionally include a time out in minutes and this is the length of time in minutes

22
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,340
that cloud formation will wait for the nested stack to complete and the default is that there is no

23
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,170
time out.

24
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,400
And this is completely optional.

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,740
So the only element that is mandatory is the template you RL.

26
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,390
So let's take a look at some of our exam tips.

27
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,120
Just remember nested stacks allow you to reuse your cloud formation code.

28
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,920
So for common use cases you don't need to copy paste.

29
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,670
You can just reference the confirmation code from within your cloud formation template.

30
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,340
They are really useful for frequently used configurations.

31
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:38,820
So for example for a frequently used configuration for a load balancer web server application server

32
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,580
and all you need to do is create a cloud formation template defining the resource that you want to create

33
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,790
store in S3 and then you can reference it from the resources section of any cloud formation template

34
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,800
using the stack resource type so that if everything that you need to know about it's tax for the exam

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,420
if you have any questions please let me know.

36
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,910
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

37
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,490
Thank ye.
