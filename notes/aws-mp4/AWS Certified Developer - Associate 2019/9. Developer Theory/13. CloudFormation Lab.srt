00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:08,780
Hello cloggers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is going to be a cloud formation lab and

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,350
we're going to make our very first cloud formation stack.

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,140
So let's get started.

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:24,920
So here I am in the AWOS console and you'll find cloud formation under management tools.

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:30,830
So it's not under compute it's actually under management tools because that's exactly what it is.

6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,690
So we use it to deploy and manage resources using templates.

7
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:42,390
So click on cloud formation and the first thing we're going to do is just click on Create new stack.

8
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,670
And here it's asking you to select a template.

9
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:54,200
Now you can either create a new template on the fly using design a template but we are going to use

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,170
a template that I've already created.

11
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,720
They also do have sample templates here and you can play around with some of the sample templates that

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
they have as well.

13
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:09,880
So for example you can create a WordPress blog lampstand or ruby on rails etc..

14
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,370
So a few different sample templates that you can have a play around with.

15
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:21,080
But we're going to use a template that I've already created and you can either specify an Amazon S3

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,530
template you RL If you have one already uploaded to S-3.

17
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,460
If not you can just click on Choose file and you can select a file from your local machine.

18
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:36,950
So I've already created this cloud formation template here and I'm just going to walk through the template

19
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,110
and show you exactly what were creating him.

20
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,710
So here is my template and it's a really simple template on all it's going to do is create an easy to

21
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:51,920
instance and enable us to S-sh onto that new instance as well.

22
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,310
So first of all we have the template format version and it's always going to be 2010 0 9 0 9 because

23
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,290
it's the only supported template format version.

24
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:08,840
Next we have our description and the description is that it's just a template to create an easy to instance

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:17,900
and enable S-sh then moving on to parameters and we're defining a parameter called key name.

26
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:26,080
And it's going to be the name of an S-sh key pad that I have located on my system to enable me to log

27
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,710
into my PC to instance.

28
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:35,830
So it's got a type and it's also got a constraint description to remind us to provide the name of an

29
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,270
existing S-sh keypad.

30
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:46,360
So remember parameters is used for inputting parameters into cloud formation when we launch the stack.

31
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,300
Then the next section the most important section is resources.

32
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:56,940
So this section defines the resources that we are asking cloud formation to create for us.

33
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:06,490
And the first resource is called My easy to instance it's type is AWOS easy to instance under properties

34
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:14,830
we have an instance type which is going to be T-2 micro then Image ID and this is the a.m.-I the Amazon

35
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:21,310
machine image that we're going to use to launch the instant so the operating system and this line is

36
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:27,890
really important because this is the AWOS the next who I am I which is located in EU West one.

37
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:34,780
Now if you remember I am Mei's they are region specific and if I tried to access this I am from a different

38
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,450
region.

39
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,380
So I tried to launch this confirmation stack in a different region for launch in U.S. East one for example

40
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,440
isn't going to work.

41
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,110
So what you need to do is replace this.

42
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,310
I am my day with another.

43
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:53,750
I am available in your region and I'm just going to show you how to find one of those.

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:01,030
So come back to your console click on services and go to easy to I'm just going to open it in a new

45
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,200
tab.

46
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,720
If you click on launch instance I make sure you're in the region that you like a region that you want

47
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,740
to work in.

48
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:17,230
So for example if you're working in U.S. aist you can just select the region and then copy.

49
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,780
Am I.

50
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,010
Id just copy that and then place that into your file.

51
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,380
So that will just make sure that you don't show instance in the correct region and you are using the

52
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,690
correct I am Id feel region.

53
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,740
Otherwise it will not work.

54
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,030
So that's the only thing that you need to change in this file.

55
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,170
Just make sure you update that I am ID with a valid then x 2.

56
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,860
I am for the region in which you are working.

57
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:50,170
Then this next line key name is actually referencing the name that we created up here which is our canine

58
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,100
parameter.

59
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:59,040
So it's telling cloud formation to use to associate this S-sh keypad with on instance to allow us to

60
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,500
S-sh into the instance.

61
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,330
We can also apply tacks here.

62
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,950
I've just created a user defined tag of name and the value is going to be my FCF instance and then the

63
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:16,890
next resource we're creating is going to be a brand new security group and this security group is going

64
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:21,180
to enable S-sh access for port 22.

65
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:32,750
It's going to have one ingress rule allowing TZP traffic on port 22 from an IP range of 0.0 0.0 forward

66
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,630
slash their own.

67
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,810
So in other words enabling S-sh to the entire world to this instance and then the last section of the

68
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,730
file is going to be outputs.

69
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:48,930
And in this case I'm asking how information to output the instance ID of the new PC to instance that

70
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,220
we have created.

71
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:56,640
So that is the really simple capitalization template and once you have updated your ID then we are ready

72
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,010
to continue.

73
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:03,920
So come back to the console back to the cloud formation console and I'm just going to check up here

74
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,360
and make sure that I'm in the correct region so I need to be an EU Ireland which is EU west one to match

75
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,010
my I am I.

76
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:19,380
And now I'm going to select choose File and it's going to be my cloud formation template Jamo click

77
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,260
on next.

78
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,290
And we need to give a name to all stack.

79
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:27,600
So you just give your stock a name and we need to select all SISIA sites keypad and it's coming up under

80
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,610
parameters.

81
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,670
So remember that was our parameters section of a file.

82
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,630
So I'm going to select a key pad that I know that I have on my system and it should only show you the

83
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,680
key pads that are available for the region for which you are working and just click next.

84
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,030
We don't need to add any more options in here but just come down to the advanced section and I just

85
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:55,440
want to show you down here that we have this rollback on failure feature and this defines whether the

86
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,780
stack is rolled back.

87
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,250
If part of the stack creation files.

88
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,180
So you'd have a choice and by default it's set to Yes.

89
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:09,330
So this means if something goes wrong with the information provisioning then it will automatically Roback

90
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,450
the whole thing.

91
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:16,680
So for example if there's a problem with your YAML template and cloud formation cannot deploy the infrastructure

92
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:22,860
the resources that you have specified in the way that you specified them then it will automatically

93
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,810
rollback.

94
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,880
However you have the opportunity to set it to no.

95
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:33,390
So you could set it to know if for example you wanted to debug a cloud formation stack that was constantly

96
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,270
failing.

97
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,190
You might want to set its notes to try and understand what is actually going wrong here.

98
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,000
And if you're doing this from the API for example as a disable Roback flag that you would use but from

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,540
within the console you can just disable rollback.

100
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:53,390
Just basically toggling this radio button but we're just going to keep that to the default because hopefully

101
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:59,660
this isn't going to file and we're going to click on next and then click Create and it can take a few

102
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,190
minutes for it to actually go ahead and create this.

103
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,400
Sometimes it can take about three or four minutes.

104
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,690
So I'm going to pose the video now and come back to this when it is complete.

105
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,070
So that has now completed.

106
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,520
And if your status has not updated you can just hit the refresh button here.

107
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:21,320
I'm not going to click on my stack and down here we can see all the events associated with the cloud

108
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,270
formation tasks.

109
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,840
We can also view the template that we uploaded.

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,790
We can look at any parameters that the parameter that we provided and we can also look at outputs as

111
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,310
well.

112
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:37,310
So this was why at the end of the template where we asked cloud formations to give us an output and

113
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,990
the output is the instance Id And that is the value.

114
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:48,310
So let's go to our easy to dashboard and see if we can find on instance so come to se.

115
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,350
And there is our instance so it's running.

116
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:57,170
There is the name for instance my C-f instance if we look down here at the properties of the instance

117
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,020
you should have the key pen name that you specified.

118
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,530
You can view the embed rules as well of the security group.

119
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,940
You should have caught 22 for everyone.

120
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,220
So it looks like it successfully created everything for us.

121
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:19,670
It's created or easy to instance using that pen name and it has also given us port 22 in the associated

122
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,890
security group.

123
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:27,140
So that should be everything that we need to actually go ahead and look into our new instance.

124
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:33,970
So first of all I'm just going to copy the public IP and I'm going to move to my terminal window now

125
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,790
I'm just going to try and S-sh in that instance.

126
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,280
So I'm going to run SISIA.

127
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:49,390
Mine is I named my key pad which is my all and key pair to come easy to use at.

128
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,230
And then Thyssen the public IP address of money for instance

129
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:02,600
and then we also create star instance it's opened up the port for S-sh and it's also associated that

130
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,280
S-sh key with on instance as well.

131
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,740
So that is cloud formation.

132
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,240
You can see that it's really really simple to use.

133
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,740
It's really really easy.

134
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,380
And if we go back to our console we can actually get confirmation to delete the whole stack as well.

135
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:27,690
So if we come back to the console going to go to services confirmation actions and delete stack yes

136
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,520
delete on it should delete the whole lot for you.

137
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,080
And there's one other thing I want to show you.

138
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:38,410
If you come down to S-3 you'll see that confirmation.

139
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:44,230
It actually creates a bucket hat with your cloud formation templates in and so located in here if you

140
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,260
make it public you can actually download your confirmation template there.

141
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,940
So when you upload a template into confirmation it actually stores in an S3 bucket on what's cloud formation

142
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,490
has successfully deleted all your resources.

143
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,770
You'll be able to delete this bucket as well but you're going to struggle to delete it before confirmation

144
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:07,450
has finished deleting resources because there's a dependency on this bucket.

145
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,850
So that is really everything you should need to know for the exam for cloud formation.

146
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,630
If you have any questions please let me know.

147
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,430
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

148
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,280
Thank you.
