00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:07,630
Hello Cokers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is going to be a code deploy nap and we're

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:12,970
going to do a few things in this lab first we're going to create our own E.S. to instance which is going

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:18,070
to have access to an S3 bucket where our code is going to be stored.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,560
We're then going to install the code deploy agent onto our easy to instance and then we're going to

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,170
use code deploy to deploy a really simple web application to our AC to instance.

6
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,690
So if I got time please join me in the U.S. consulate.

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,020
So here I am in the console and the first thing that we're going to do is where we need to create are

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,460
easy to instance.

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,770
But before we do that we're going to configure a service role with ESRI access.

10
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,780
So they are easy to instance can access an S3 bucket containing our source code.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,920
So first of all we're going to find security identity and compliance on the console and a way to click

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,680
on I am and we're going to go to roles and create grow.

13
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:04,050
And it's going to be a service role for the E.C. to instant make sure the AC 2 is selected.

14
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,780
Click on next Am I going to search for the S-3 full access policy.

15
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,140
Click on next.

16
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,720
I'm going to give our own name.

17
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:17,930
I'm just going to call it my S-3 role and then click Create more.

18
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,220
We also have to create a service role with a code deploy as well.

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,670
So this is going to be an identity access management role which allows code deploy to make API calls

20
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:34,360
on your behalf and it's going to give code deploy permission to install applications on your AC to instances.

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,550
If we go into service roles find code deploy and select or use case at the bottom.

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,000
So this is to allow code deploy its core services such as auto scanning on your behalf and we want it

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,040
for easy to not for lambda so select Code deploy next on it's already selected the correct policy.

24
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,120
So we can take a look at this policy.

25
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,600
I'm going to open a new tab so we can just have a look at the policy.

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,800
So this policy allows code deployed to do all these different actions for auto scaling describe instances

27
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,190
and terminate instances for easy to read the tags.

28
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:16,630
It gives access to cloud watch and also registering and registering instances with your light balancer.

29
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,890
So those are all the permissions that will get applied to code deploy.

30
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:28,090
So if we come back to our management console click on next and we're just going to give it a name and

31
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,610
I'm going to call it CD service roll and click on Create.

32
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,140
Whoa.

33
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,310
So now we are ready to launch our AC to instance.

34
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:44,530
So come back to services and find AC to under compute click on launch instance and we're going to stick

35
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,250
with the Linux too am I.

36
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,640
So I select that one to my car click on next and we can keep most of the day.

37
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,340
So it's going to load into the default PC.

38
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,890
We don't need to specify the subnet you want to make sure that it's going to auto assign a public IP

39
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,980
because we're going to be installing a web application on this instance so we want to make sure that

40
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,700
we can reach it over the Internet so just make sure that setting enable is selected.

41
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,600
Scroll down to identity access management role and we're going to select the S3 roll that we've just

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:25,370
created and click Next Next the text section we're going to add a tag I'm going to add a tag code name

43
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,730
and I'm going to call my application my web app.

44
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,340
So code deploy is going to use these tasks to identify the instances that you're going to deploy the

45
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,420
application to.

46
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,640
So that is why we need to apply tax to our easy to instance.

47
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,060
So then click on next.

48
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,530
And for the security group we can just stick with the launch wizard security group by default.

49
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:54,130
It's going to give us S-sh And we're also going to add the rule for HGT page so just select HTP and

50
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,200
get to the rest of the defaults and then hit review and launch and before it launches the instance it's

51
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,870
going to ask you to select an existing key pair or to create a new one.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,170
Now if you already have a key pair for this region then you can go ahead and use that if you don't have.

53
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,290
Don't worry you can just select Create a new key pad and it will go ahead and create one for you and

54
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,760
you can save the dot PEM file that it produces locally.

55
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,170
So I'm just going to acknowledge I have access and hit launch instances.

56
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:31,000
So now my instance has been created and I'm just going to copy the IP address and I'm going to go and

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,460
look into my instance.

58
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:40,160
So first of all I'm just going to make sure I'm in the correct directory for my key pad.

59
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,570
So that's my key pad.

60
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,540
So now I'm going to run S-sh minus.

61
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,200
And then the name of my key pad.

62
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,590
And then easy to dush user at.

63
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,630
And then the IP address of my instance.

64
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,370
So now that we've looked into our instance the next thing we need to do is install the code deploy agent

65
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,050
on our PC to instance.

66
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:05,810
And if you take a look at the resources section of this lecture I've included a text file with all the

67
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,290
commands that you need to run.

68
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,880
So let's go ahead and have a look at that in the text editor.

69
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,280
So these are all the different commands that you need to do in order to install the code deploy agent

70
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,130
on your PC to instance.

71
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,560
So firstly we're going to do some update.

72
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,060
We're then going to install Ruby.

73
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:29,870
We're going to install you get and then we're going to use you get to get the code deploy Agent files

74
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:34,610
and they're actually stored in an S3 bucket and it's specific to a region.

75
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,070
And actually you're going to need to change this region according to where you are working from where

76
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,960
you've deployed your instance where you're going to deploy your S3 bucket etc..

77
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,700
So it says a central one.

78
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,390
That's not correct for me.

79
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,320
I'm actually in using a West too today.

80
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,400
So go ahead and change that to the correct region if you don't change it it doesn't really matter.

81
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,870
Are you still going to be able to download it.

82
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,260
It's just going to be quicker if you use a region local to you.

83
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,180
And then the next thing we're going to do is we're going to add execute permission to the install files

84
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,480
that we download and then we're going to install the code deploy agent.

85
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:15,410
And then finally this last command is to just check that the code deploy agent has been successfully

86
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,530
deployed.

87
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,880
So let's go ahead and cut and paste those commands into our easy to instance.

88
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,100
I'm just going to add one is why so.

89
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,660
Well

90
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,590
then install Ruby

91
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,420
install get

92
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:50,420
with then get a CD in the user's home directory would then use this W get command to install the latest

93
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,150
code deploy Agent files on all system

94
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,510
which is going to change the permissions and execute permissions to the install file.

95
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,320
Then run the installation.

96
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,330
And then finally we're going to check the status of our code deploy agent

97
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,410
so the code agent is running.

98
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,970
That's it's process ID so that has successfully been installed.

99
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,320
Now the next thing we need to do is actually on our local machine.

100
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,800
So we need to configure our local machine as the developing machine which is going to connect into code

101
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,230
deploy and it's going to package up all code and upload it to S3 for code deploy to use.

102
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:48,740
So in order to do that we need to create a new identity access management user with all the permissions

103
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,310
required to do that.

104
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:56,660
And then we're going to run AWOS configure on our local machine with the relevant user credentials.

105
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,620
So first of all I'm going to go back to identity access management in the console.

106
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:10,180
Click on uses Adisa and I'm going to call my user CD user I'm going to give some programmatic access

107
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,250
as well because I want to be able to run AWOS configure and supply the access key and seek access key.

108
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,160
So then hit permissions.

109
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,370
I'm going to directly attach existing policies.

110
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:26,710
So the first one my going to add is for code deploy.

111
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:34,220
So I'm just going to add code deploy full access and I'm also going to add as three full access as well.

112
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,490
So then click on next uncreate user.

113
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,390
So I use has been created Amico access key and secret access key.

114
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,730
And this is what we're going to use when we run AWOS configure on our local machine.

115
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:52,000
So first of all I'm just going to copy the access key come to a terminal window and make sure this time

116
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,500
your on your local machine.

117
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:02,340
So for me that's my back and I'm going to run AWOS configure and it's going to ask for the access key.

118
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,050
I want to use.

119
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:11,180
So I'm just going to control the news the access key come back to the console and grab the access key.

120
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,570
I'm going to keep to my default region name of EU west too.

121
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,170
You need to make sure it's the same region that you're going to be working in.

122
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:27,530
So the same one you've created for instance and we're going to keep my deep throat at the format as

123
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:34,590
text so hit enter in preparation for this lab I've created a set of deployment files on my local machine.

124
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:43,000
So I'm going to show you the files that I've created now so I've got a directory called my web app and

125
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,520
inside that directory I've got a file called aspect to Jamo and that is the configuration file used

126
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,950
by code deploy.

127
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,330
I've also got index to.

128
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:57,580
Which is a simple web page that we're going to be installing on the easy to instance.

129
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:03,430
And then finally I've got this script directory and this just includes pre and post installation scripts

130
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,160
which are going to be run at different stages of the deployment.

131
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:12,040
So I'm going to show you these files in the text editor because it's just going to be a lot easier for

132
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,050
you to read them.

133
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,120
So let's just take a look at these in the text and it's in now.

134
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:23,590
So the first four we're going to look at is aspect to Jamo and the purpose of aspect of Jamo is to define

135
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,620
all the primitives needed for the code deploy deployment.

136
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,280
So first of all we have a version number.

137
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:37,240
Then the operating system that they this applies to then any files that we want to copy to the instance

138
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:43,000
so in this case it's going to be indexed to HMO the destination on our instance that they are going

139
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,980
to be copied to.

140
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:51,520
So within easy to instance this is going to be copied into opt of HMO and then this hook section defines

141
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,430
the commands that we want to run during the deployment.

142
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,060
And when we want to run them.

143
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:03,440
So before the installation there's a script which installs any dependencies and there's also a couple

144
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,830
of scripts to stop the application and also to start the application.

145
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,310
So let's take a look at some of these files.

146
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,780
So first of all is the index so I checked him out and it's just really a simple web page that just says

147
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,700
hello talkers.

148
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,320
This is version 1 of my application the dependencies file.

149
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:27,060
All that does is if it's not already installed it will install TPD.

150
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:34,030
And then the start service script simply just starts HTP day and the stop server just stops.

151
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,030
TPD.

152
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,970
So these are all the files that we need to build our deployment.

153
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,330
And the app spec Jamo is the most important one.

154
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,620
And at the moment these files are just installed on my local machine but we need to get them into an

155
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,500
S-3 pocket in order for code to deploy to access them.

156
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,680
So we're going to come back to the console to configure our S3 packet.

157
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:04,090
So I'm going to go into services and find S-3 under storage concreate buckets and I'm going to call

158
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:13,050
my pocket CD buckets Tasche Fe click on next next next and create bucket.

159
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:19,690
So now we're ready to bundle up our application files create our application Inco deploy and then upload

160
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,210
our application code Pando into this S3 bucket and we have a few different commands that we're going

161
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,060
to run from the command line in order to do this.

162
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:34,880
So I'm just going to come back to my terminal and the first command we're going to run is going to create

163
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,110
the application within code deploy and it's going to name the application.

164
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:45,590
My web app and don't worry these commands are going to be included in the resources section of the course.

165
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:51,200
So you'll just be able to copy and paste them into your terminal and then once that's done the second

166
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,750
command that we need to run it just pushes the application fall into our S3 bucket and you're going

167
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:02,140
to need to go in and add the correct bucket name for your for the bucket you just created.

168
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,110
So I need to change that name

169
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,400
and then hit enter.

170
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:15,140
So that has created all application within code deploy and it's also pushed the application zip file

171
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,870
into all three buckets.

172
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:22,670
And of course the zip file it just contains all apps aspect to YAML or indexed to HDMI.

173
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,600
And all scripts directory as well.

174
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,380
So what's going you can just down that web app does it from the resources section of the course.

175
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,700
So let's go back now to Arkansas.

176
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,580
IMO have a look in S-3 bucket and just make sure that has been copied across correctly.

177
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,610
So if we go into a bucket that we should see web app does it and it's just been copied over that just

178
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,580
a second ago.

179
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,000
So now we're ready to deploy this application using code deploy.

180
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:55,550
So let's come back to services and come down to code deploy and it's under developed tools.

181
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:01,160
So just click on code deploy and the application we've just created using that command should already

182
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,810
appear in your code to deploy dashboards So there is.

183
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:09,050
So we're just going to click on the app and now we're going to define a deployment group and this is

184
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:13,880
going to define the host or the group of hosts but we're going to be deploying our code too.

185
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,840
So just click on Create deployment group and we need to give it a name.

186
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,280
I'm just going to call it my digi and we need to select a service role.

187
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:29,490
Which code deploy is going to use to access our target instances and it's just going to be the see service

188
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,520
role that we created at the beginning of the lab.

189
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:38,280
So just select that one then for deployment type there's two choices so we have that in place and the

190
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:45,160
blue screen and of course the in place is when each instance is briefly taken offline during the deployment.

191
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,240
So that means the instance is not available during the time of the deployment.

192
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,360
And then we have the blue green and this is one way you spin up new instances and you deploy to those

193
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,960
new instances and then once your new instances are healthy you can then terminate your original instances

194
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,730
as soon as you are ready.

195
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,740
But because we only have one host is it Poitou and it's the very first time we're deploying this application.

196
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,460
We can just go ahead and use the in place upgrade.

197
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,160
It doesn't make sense to use blue green in this case.

198
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,300
Then for Environment configuration.

199
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:26,810
So you can select any combination of either auto scanning groups easy to instances or on premises instances

200
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,830
to run this deployment on.

201
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:36,110
And in this case we're going to be using 82 instances and then it's asking us to define which instances

202
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,350
we want to deploy to using the instance tags.

203
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:45,020
So if you remember we created our tag attached to our instance and the tag was called app name and the

204
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,160
valley was my web app.

205
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:54,020
So moving down to deployment settings we can choose to either deploy to all of our instances at once

206
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:59,810
we can do one at a time we can do half at a time because the first time we're deploying an application

207
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,640
it makes sense to use all at once.

208
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,740
But if you're in a production environment and you only want to deploy to half of your instances at a

209
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,630
time you have the opportunity to select that using this dropdown list.

210
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,640
So we're just going to stick to all at once if you're using a load balance.

211
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:21,260
You can use the load balancer to manage the incoming traffic and manage the load across New.

212
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,570
In the original deployment we don't have a load balance.

213
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,510
So I'm going to de-select that and then click on Create a deployment group so that deployment group

214
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,320
created.

215
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,280
And then finally the last step in the process is to just go ahead and click Create deployment.

216
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,540
So our deployment group is selected.

217
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,440
It knows the name of our application.

218
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,800
It's going to easy two systems.

219
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,680
It's going to be an in place deployment.

220
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,590
The revision is stored in Amazon S3.

221
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:56,280
And if we click on this search box it should select all web Aptos zip file located in the three bucket.

222
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:02,300
So we're moving down you have some settings around Roback configuration and how you want code deployed

223
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,910
to behave.

224
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,190
If some part of the deployment files.

225
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:11,180
So for example if you try to run a deployment but then you find a file on the target instance has the

226
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,210
same name as the file in your application.

227
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,140
What are you going to do.

228
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,730
Are you going to file or are you going to overwrite or are you going to try to retain both.

229
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,150
So you can select your settings as you wish there.

230
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,640
And there's also a rollback configuration as well.

231
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:32,180
So you can override the default rollback settings so what happens when a deployment files.

232
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,180
What happens when certain cloud watch alarm thresholds are met as well.

233
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,240
So you can choose to disable rollbacks or you can it enable rollbacks.

234
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:47,820
So I'm just going to keep to the defaults for all of those and then go ahead and create deployment.

235
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,830
So now our planet is in progress.

236
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,410
And you should see the status indicator here.

237
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,370
And sometimes it does take a few minutes.

238
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,130
But there we go.

239
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,530
That has succeeded.

240
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,250
So hopefully that's worked for you and you have the same succeeded message as well.

241
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,380
And we can actually check our deployment check what's actually been provisioned for us if we go back

242
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,830
into services.

243
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:13,070
Easy to just grab the public IP for instance.

244
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:19,410
I put a new tab in our browser and hopefully you should see the same web page.

245
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,070
So it's basically installed the ICC P web server.

246
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:29,420
The index to ICM has been copied over onto our easy easy to instance and it's been installed involved

247
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,910
up Dab-Dab HMO.

248
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:38,120
An easy to instance is now serving this Web site and that has all been deployed using code diploidy.

249
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,470
So that is the end of this lecture.

250
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,910
If you have any questions please let me know.

251
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,450
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

252
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,080
Thank you.
