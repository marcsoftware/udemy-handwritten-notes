Hello Clockers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is called Identity access management.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,830
One on.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:14,670
And I am is the best place to start with AWOS because it's all about setting up your uses and granting

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,840
those users access to the IWM.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,820
So let's get started.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,180
So what is I am.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:30,480
Well essentially I am allows you to manage uses and also manage that level of access to the AWOS console

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:38,700
and it's really important to understand I am and how it works both for the exam and for administrating

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,900
companies I ws account in real life.

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,550
So what does I am give you.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,770
It gives you centralized control over your AWOS account.

12
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,150
It also gives you shared access to AWOS account.

13
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,750
It gives you granular permissions.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,530
So this means you can enable different levels of access to different users within your organization

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:13,020
it enables identity federation including with Active Directory Facebook and linked in etc..

16
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:20,620
So this means it can enable users to log in using credentials stored in an Active Directory Facebook

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,100
or linked in.

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:29,680
It allows multi-factor authentication and this is where a user is granted access only after successfully

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,960
completing multiple independent authentication mechanisms.

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,470
So for example providing a username and password as one authentication mechanism and then providing

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:51,320
a software token site that could be via a token generator like Google authenticator as the second authentication

22
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,340
mechanism.

23
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:59,920
It also provides temporary access for users or devices and services as necessary.

24
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:07,950
So for example if you developed a web or mobile phone application you can configure identity access

25
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:15,960
management to enable users to have temporary access to AWOS resources within your account for example

26
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:24,520
to enable access to store or retrieve data located in an Esrey packet or within a dynamo D-B database.

27
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,100
It allows you to set up your own password rotation policy it integrates with many different IWM services

28
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:41,170
and it supports PCI DSS compliance for any applications associated with the payment card industry.

29
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,400
So there are some cool concepts that you need to understand before going into the exam.

30
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,330
So first of all we have users.

31
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:56,860
So this is the end users and just think people say these are the people logging into the AWOS Consolo

32
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,560
and also interacting with AWOS by running IP like commands.

33
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:09,690
We didn't have groups which are collections of users grouped together with a common set of permissions.

34
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:17,200
So for example your marketing team might need access to read and write certain files stored in an S3

35
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,850
bucket and that might be logos or images et cetera and they're going to need a specific set of permissions

36
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,270
to allow them to do this.

37
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,820
So it makes sense to create a group with the required permissions and then all you need to do is add

38
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,840
the relevant users into that group and they will all have permissions to read us three buckets.

39
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:45,850
And similarly you might have a database administration's team and they need to create Modibo tables

40
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,010
and run queries on the database.

41
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:53,140
So in that case you can create a group with the relevant permissions for Dynamo IDB and then add all

42
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,390
of your database admins into that group.

43
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,210
And we also have roles.

44
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,290
Now you can create rows and then assign them to AWOS resources.

45
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:10,100
So a role is used to define a set of commissions for example S-3 bucket access and then that role could

46
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,570
be assumed by either uses or AWOS services such as AC too.

47
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,710
So you might have an easy to instance which needs to query a database or access files in S-3 and you

48
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,180
can configure that using a road.

49
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:30,980
And finally we have policies and a policy is a document that defines either one or more commissions

50
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,550
and a policy can be attached to either a user group or role.

51
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:42,920
And when we attach a policy the user group or row will then have the permissions defined within that

52
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,650
policy.

53
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:48,340
And it's possible for a user group and wrote to all share the same policy.

54
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,150
So the quickest way to learn Identity Crisis management is actually to start using it.

55
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,860
And that's what we're going to do right now.

56
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,450
So if you've got time please join me in the next lecture which is an identity access management lab.

57
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:00,950
Thank you.
