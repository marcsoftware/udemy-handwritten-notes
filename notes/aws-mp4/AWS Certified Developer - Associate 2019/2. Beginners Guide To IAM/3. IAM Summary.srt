Hello Cocker's and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is going to be a summary of identity axis

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,430
not a human one.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,220
I won.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,190
So we're going to cover off everything that we've learnt and also are going to be telling you some of

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,990
the exam tips that we have for the section as well.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,500
So let's get started.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:28,380
So what if we don't so far identity access management consists of uses groups browes policy documents

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,820
and if you remember the lab we created a couple of uses.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:40,460
We also created a couple of groups and we use those groups to apply permissions policies to those uses.

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:48,360
And we also applied policies directly to the uses and we have an example of a policy document here written

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,480
in Jason and the document is written as a series of key value pairs.

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:00,960
So under the version we don't have the statement The effect is allow and the action is to allow all

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,380
actions across all resources.

14
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,370
So this policy document would give full access to everything within us.

15
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,900
And then finally in our lab we also created a role and we created a role which can be used by an EASY

16
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:23,530
TO instance to allow access to read and write files within S-3 since the access management is universal.

17
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,210
It doesn't apply to regions at this time.

18
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,120
So what does that mean.

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,720
It just means that identity access management is global and anything you set up within I am can be viewed

20
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,680
and utilized by any region.

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,910
The root account is simply the account you created when you first set up your AWOS account.

22
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:47,520
So that's the email address that you used when you first registered your account with AWOS and it has

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,920
complete admin access.

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,000
So of course for day to day activities we shouldn't be using the root account.

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,670
Instead we should be creating identity access management uses and making sure those users have the permissions

26
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,880
and privileges they need to do their jobs.

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,720
New users have no permissions at all when they first created.

28
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,210
So we need to explicitly ask the permissions they need to do their role.

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,670
For example in the lab we added commissions for S-3 and glazier for our H.R. user to enable them to

30
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,250
access those AWOS services.

31
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,580
New users are assigned the Access Key ID and seek access key when the very first created and these are

32
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,160
not the same as a username and password.

33
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,260
You can't use the access key and secret access key to log into the WS console but you can use it access

34
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,080
AWOS for the API and come online interface from your local desktop and you only get to view and download

35
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,220
the file containing your access key and secret access key.

36
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:53,190
One time when you initially create them and after that you can still view the access key but you cannot

37
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,490
view the secret access key again.

38
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:01,310
So if you lose your secret access key you're going to need to regenerate ukase.

39
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:08,010
So to make sure that you save your secret access key in a safe location always sets up multi-factor

40
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:08,920
authentication.

41
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,850
Or if a on your root account and that's another thing that we did in the lab.

42
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:20,400
And finally you can create and customize your own password rotation policies.

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,850
So that's the end of this section.

44
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,280
Well done for completing the section.

45
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,010
If you have any questions please let me know.

46
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,700
Otherwise please join us in the next lecture.

47
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,330
Thank you.
