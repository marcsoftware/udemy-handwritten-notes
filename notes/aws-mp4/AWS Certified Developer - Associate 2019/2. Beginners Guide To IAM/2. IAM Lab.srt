00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:06,990
Hello Clockers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is going to be an identity access management

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,330
lab.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,400
So we're going to configure our user account.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,710
We're going to set up multi-factor authentication and we're going to create a first user group and set

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,920
up a role as well.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,360
So you're going to need to log into the IWM console.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,560
So if he got time please join me in the console.

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:33,890
Here I am in the console and this is a brand new AWOS account that I've set up specifically for this

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,530
lab.

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,450
So it has not been used before.

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,780
When you first walk into the console you'll notice that there's a few different wizards here.

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:46,080
There's also some tutorials and videos here some of which are free.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,080
Then if you come to the top of the screen on the right hand side you'll notice that we have a list of

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,630
different regions here.

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,410
And normally the best thing to do is select the region that is closest to you.

16
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,210
So I'm located in London.

17
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,090
So London is my closest region.

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,220
And that's the one I generally try to use either that Orlando Frankfurt.

19
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,240
And they're all very fast for London.

20
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,740
However when they launch a brand new service in WS they don't launch it to every single region at the

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,040
same time.

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,460
So you may find that if you're looking at my screen certain services that appear on my screen that don't

23
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,900
appear in your screen.

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,360
And the reason for that could be that if you're in a different region it may be that that service is

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,360
not yet available in your region and generally when they launch into service it normally gets launched

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,440
to us East which is the North Virginia region.

27
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,920
Generally that's the place where they launch the new services that get lost that first and then overtime

28
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,930
it later on gets made available throughout the other regions.

29
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,130
So if you see something on your screen that you're expecting to see or that you can see on my screen

30
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,040
the best thing to do is simply change regions and see if you can point to in another region.

31
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:59,120
So let's get started with identity access management and the first thing I'm going to do is come to

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:06,620
the top left of the screen and click on services and you'll see there are loads of different services

33
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:15,220
provided within AWOS and identity access management comes under security identity and compliance.

34
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:21,780
So go ahead and click on I am and the first thing that you should see is a splash screen similar to

35
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,680
this.

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,730
Welcome to identity access management.

37
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:35,280
It also shows you a site in Menke and this number here is your customer account number and it's a personalized

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,950
link that you can use to log into the console.

39
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,590
And if you want to you can actually customize it to make a much more friendly you or else I'm going

40
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,520
to go ahead and see if I can customize this.

41
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:54,300
I'm just going to call mine a cloud guru Fay and see if I can use that name yet.

42
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,040
So that is changed my sign in link.

43
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,240
So next time I want to look into the console I can just simply use that link instead and it will take

44
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,840
me straight to my console and we can say here on the I am resources that we don't have any users groups

45
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:16,980
or policies or rows or identity providers created and in the security status section they give you this

46
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:23,490
checklist of the minimum kind of security baseline that they recommend you apply to every single account

47
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,190
and the first one is delete your access case.

48
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,030
With that they've already done that for you.

49
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,900
The second one is to activate multi-factor authentication on your router account.

50
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:39,750
So that means to enable another level of authentication beyond the username and password that you use

51
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:47,060
to log into your account with the next step would be to create individual identity axis management uses.

52
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,210
Because we don't want everyone within our organization to be logging into AWOS using the root account.

53
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,040
It's best practice to only use that account when you really really need to when there's no other way

54
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,370
to do the tasks that you're trying to do.

55
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:08,250
Instead you'll want to restrict access to your users and only gives them access they need to do that

56
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,240
job.

57
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:17,900
So we would create individual identity access management uses them to a relevant group and assign permissions

58
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:24,220
on a group by great basis according to the job function that your users are doing.

59
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:31,880
For example your database administrator is my only need access to the databases running in a W-S and

60
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:40,370
your teams might need access to certain S-3 buckets within ws whereas your systems administrators would

61
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,010
again need a completely different level of access and we'd need access to administer various resources

62
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,400
within a WS.

63
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:54,440
So it's best practice to create individual user accounts for your users then group them into logical

64
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:54,930
groups.

65
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:03,650
For example our database administration systems administration etc. and then assign the relevant permissions

66
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,100
to each of those groups on a group by group basis.

67
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:12,380
And then the final thing it advises you to do is to apply a password policy.

68
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,470
So that's all about password complexity and lifecycle management as well.

69
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,780
So let's go ahead and activate multi-factor authentication on our account.

70
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:32,510
So if you click on the arrow here the then click on manage MFA and there's two different types of MFI

71
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,320
device.

72
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:39,900
But we're going to use the virtual MFA device make sure that one is selected and click on next.

73
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:47,880
And now to activate the MFA device you first need to install an MFA compatible application and we normally

74
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:55,050
install that on a smartphone PC or other device and you can find a list of the MFH compatible applications.

75
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,980
If you click this link here so let's just click on that

76
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,830
scroll down and the supported virtual MFI applications.

77
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:11,520
There's a few different ones supported for Android iPhone Windows phone and BlackBerry.

78
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,750
But I have an iPhone so I'm going to be using Google authenticator.

79
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:22,320
So depending on which device you're using download the relevant MFA application and then come back to

80
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,810
the console.

81
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,650
So once you've downloaded the relevant MFA application just click on next step and then it will show

82
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:37,940
you this QR code which you need to scan using the MFA application on your device.

83
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:49,260
So on my phone here I'm going to select scan barcode and it gives me the six digit authentication code

84
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,930
which I need to type in my web page

85
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,680
and then I need to wait until that code expires and it's going to give me another code.

86
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,150
And there it is.

87
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,560
And I'm just going to type it in here.

88
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:13,470
And click activate and you should get this message that the MFA device is successfully associated.

89
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:21,410
So now if that was successful you should have a green tick next to your activate MFA on account.

90
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,310
And if it was successful and you don't see the green tick just refresh the browser on that quintic should

91
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,370
show up.

92
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,320
So the next thing we're going to do is create some identity access management eases.

93
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,430
So click on users on the left hand side

94
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:49,070
click on Add user and again to create a user code Fe and there's two different ways to access AWOS.

95
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:59,010
The first access type is programmatic and this enables access using the AWOS API come online interface

96
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,810
and developing toolkit as well.

97
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,060
And we call that programmatic access.

98
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:14,540
This is how applications will access AWOS and it's also how you can access the command line on your

99
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,540
local machine.

100
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:23,700
So I'm going to select programmatic access it and then the second method of accessing AWOS is by the

101
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,800
console.

102
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,340
And that's what we're doing right now.

103
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,020
So I'm going to select console access as well.

104
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:37,610
And I'm going to keep the default to an auto generated password for the console and also require a password

105
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,660
reset when the user looks in.

106
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:48,290
So just keep those last two to the default and click on next and now it's asking us to set permissions

107
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,790
for our new user.

108
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,330
So we've got a choice of how we can actually set these permissions.

109
00:08:53,330 --> 00:09:00,720
Firstly we can add user to a group so if we had groups already existing We could add them to an existing

110
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,120
group or we can create a new group we can copy permissions from an existing user.

111
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,500
And also we can attach permissions directly to the user.

112
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:19,200
But for now we're just going to go ahead and create groups or click on create great and we need to give

113
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,350
our group a name and I'm going to call the group this admin

114
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:31,130
and then next thing it's asking us to do is to add a policy and it's these policies which define the

115
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:36,110
permissions that are going to be granted to the group.

116
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,140
So this is going to be osseous Hopman group.

117
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:45,830
I'm just going to search for Azmin and there's a whole load of default policies that you can choose

118
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,250
from.

119
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:54,830
So let's have a look at the administrator access policy and if you click on this arrow and click on

120
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,420
Jason and you can actually look at the Jason code which makes up the policy.

121
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:07,010
So we've got a version on an underneath that a statement and then the effect of the policy which is

122
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,530
to allow and then action is everything.

123
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:15,400
So that means you can run any action on any resource.

124
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:23,050
So basically this is giving the user full access to AWOS and he can take a look at all of these policies

125
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,890
or look at the permissions that they give you.

126
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:31,900
So if you click on the arrow select make sure Tyson is selected and you can look at the the Jason code

127
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:39,660
and it's really just a key value pair so you can see for example in this policy allows you for cloud

128
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:48,500
trial to list the tags Look-Up events for code commit it allows you to do a poll and a get push etc..

129
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:56,670
So I'm just going to go back into administrator access make sure that that is selected and click on

130
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,850
Create group.

131
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,240
So that's our group created.

132
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,980
We've attached our policy.

133
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:09,640
I'm going to review and this just shows us all of the choices that we've selected so we've got my user

134
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:17,520
with poker Matic and console access with an auto generated password requiring a reset on first logon

135
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,480
and our user is going to be a member of this admin group and by default they're also going to be giving

136
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,960
this permission to change their password.

137
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,680
So let's go ahead and create the user so a user has been created.

138
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,470
We can also say that I've been given this access key and say access Kate.

139
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:47,840
And if we click on show it show was that secret access came on this access key and Secret Access Key

140
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:53,320
are needed when we lock in using the command line interface.

141
00:11:53,320 --> 00:12:00,910
So when we want to interact programmatically with AWOS we can only do that using the access key and

142
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:09,110
seek access key whereas if we want to log into the console that's when we would use our username and

143
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,720
password.

144
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:15,810
And it's really important to remember that the only time you get to see the same access key is when

145
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,910
you first create the user and we move away from this page we might be able to see the secret access

146
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:27,450
key again and you can download it as a CSJ so you can download it and keep it on your machine keep it

147
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,510
somewhere safe.

148
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,370
Because if we lose this secret access key We're going to have to regenerate it.

149
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,180
That's really important to know.

150
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:42,500
And it's also important to remember the difference between access and seek 6K and name and password.

151
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,430
So let's go ahead and hit close.

152
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:50,790
So now I'm going to go in and create another user and this user are going to call John the guy and give

153
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:57,870
him programatic and console access and click on next I'm going to add him to the same.

154
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,500
It's this great.

155
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,000
Click on review and create Eiza

156
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,640
and close.

157
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:15,030
Now John he is going to work for the H-L team I'm going to create a new group called H.

158
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:20,900
So he can create great Nicollet Shaw click on next.

159
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,330
Anthropology type.

160
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,810
Now the whole team we're going to give them access to S-3 to read files in S-3.

161
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:35,800
So for policy type I'm just going to search for a policy containing S-3 and we've got one here S-3 read

162
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,540
only access.

163
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:46,830
So I'm going to select the next step and create group.

164
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,360
So now we've got two groups.

165
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:54,450
We've got one for say submarines giving them full access within AWOS and there's two users who are members

166
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,780
of that group.

167
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:04,560
And we've also got our second group called H R with read only access to S-3 and then the next thing

168
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:12,270
I'm going to do is I'm going to add John into my group so I'm going to go back to John and click on

169
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,010
his name.

170
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,710
Click on groups.

171
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:25,650
Add use to groups and then select our H.R. group and click add to two groups.

172
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,910
And I can also hear if I want I can delete him from the CCBN group.

173
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm going to do that because he's not a systems administrator.

174
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,960
He works for H.R. So we're going to take that position away.

175
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,370
Click on remove from group

176
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,480
and if we go back to permissions

177
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:56,820
and click on Add permissions for John we can also add permissions directly to John.

178
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,120
Without it being on a per group basis.

179
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:06,110
So for example let's say he needs to specifically access Lycia because he's in charge of archiving as

180
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,270
well in our company.

181
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:16,820
So let's click on at existing policies directly and search for Lycia are we going to give him Lycia

182
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,670
full access.

183
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:29,700
Click on next and at permissions and then in the summary for John we can say that he has Amazon glacé

184
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:36,220
a full access which we've attached directly and then he also has this S-3 read only access which is

185
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,500
attached by the group.

186
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:45,520
So if we go back 12 dashboard we can say we've got four out of five ticks here.

187
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:51,850
And then the last thing we need to do is apply and identity excess management password policy.

188
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:59,430
So if we click on then click on manage password policy and here is where we can set up a password policy.

189
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,560
And this is simply a set of rules defining the type of password.

190
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:10,460
And I am using of set so we can define the minimum password length.

191
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,160
So I'm going to change that at 12.

192
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:20,480
We can set it to require at least one up uppercase letter one lower case letter one number.

193
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:27,680
We can set password expiration in a period of days so we can set it to expire after 90 days.

194
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:34,730
So whatever password policy you have within your organization you should be able to reflect that here

195
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,150
within AWOS as well.

196
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:44,810
So then just click on apply password policy and then if we go back to our dashboard We've got five green

197
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:52,720
ticks now the last thing we're going to do here is we're going to create a roll click on Rose

198
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,630
and I am rose or a secure white to grant permissions to entities that you trust.

199
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:08,470
And the examples they give are and I am used in another account application code running on an easy

200
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:16,510
to instance that needs to perform actions on AWOS resources and be a service that needs to act on resources

201
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,470
in your account to provide its features

202
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:28,280
and uses from a corporate directory who's you who are using identity federation with Sammo.

203
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,420
So we don't need to worry about that last one.

204
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,140
That's something that we're going to revisit in a little bit more detail later on in the course

205
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:46,440
but right now we're going to create a roll allowing an easy to instance to write files to S-3.

206
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:53,750
So let's click on Create role and we need to select the AWOS service that we want to create the profile.

207
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:59,630
So make sure AWOS service is selected choose the service that the role will use.

208
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:05,510
And we're going to select easy to click on next.

209
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:10,780
And now from the default policies we need to search for a policy relating to S3.

210
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,950
So just type as 3 in the search box

211
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:23,210
and I'm going to select as three full access and this will give any easy to instance which has this

212
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,550
role attached.

213
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,780
We'll have full access to S-3.

214
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:32,350
So I'm going to go ahead and click on next gif or roll a name

215
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:41,980
and click on Create row.

216
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:47,700
So now we've created that row we're going to be able to apply that row to an any new E.S. to instance

217
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:57,630
that we create and if we go back to the dashboard we can say we've got two uses two grapes and we got

218
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,160
one roll.

219
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,960
So that's all we're going to do with I am at the moment but you're going to be using it quite a bit

220
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,040
throughout the course.

221
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,430
So you're going to become very familiar with I am.

222
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,990
As you progress throughout the course

223
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,490
and that's the end of this lecture.

224
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,340
So if you have any questions please let me know.

225
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,110
If not please feel free to move on to the next lecture.

226
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,680
Thank you.
