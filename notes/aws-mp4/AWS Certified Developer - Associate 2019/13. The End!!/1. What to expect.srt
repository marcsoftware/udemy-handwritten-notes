00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,760
KLA cloggers Welcome to the very last lecture.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,660
In the course hopefully you've really enjoyed it and you've learnt an awful lot.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,580
It is now ready to book your exam.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,090
So let's go ahead and have a look how you can do that.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,290
OK so here I am at the AWOS training landing page.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,310
So the address is just AWOS dot training.

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,760
And I want you to click up here and go sign in then ask you to sign in using your credentials so I'm

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,880
just going to do that now.

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,480
So I've now signed in I'm just going to go over to certification and click up here then I'm going to

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:37,980
click AWOS certification account and in here it's launched me into my AWOS certification account.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,150
You can see here.

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,110
So all I need to do now is go over to Szechwan you exams.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,170
They used to be to assessment bodies webisodes the old one PSII is the new one you want to do it through

14
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,570
PSII but just go ahead and hit should you and your exam you can't do it through Websense or any more

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:00,960
it will redirect you to the pier side training site and you can see here you can go ahead and shed all

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,700
your exams.

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,320
So here is the A.W. a certified developer associate.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,750
Do you read it carefully.

19
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,300
There will be one that says for the 2018 this is actually the old one.

20
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,170
And eventually they'll get rid of this one entirely.

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,910
So go ahead and hit Cheryl your exam and you should be able to find an exam center near you and show

22
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,610
use your exam.

23
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,050
So really really good luck.

24
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,660
So once you pause please I've learned the difficult feelings in an attack.

25
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,570
And this just lets us know how many people are pulsing and so that we can congratulate you or you can

26
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,500
also tweet us the ticket and tag us.

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,950
You can also actually upload your certificate to the A Calgary phone.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,850
This will unlock your badges and it will also allow you to show off your certificates to other uses.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,990
So what are the next steps.

30
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,430
Well there are still the solutions architect associate if you haven't already done it.

31
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,260
Assistants administrators are shit.

32
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,220
I would recommend doing those too before going on and trying something like solutions architect professional.

33
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,450
We also have the specialty certificate so we've got security at big data or events networking the certificate

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,480
of follows directly after the developer associate certificate is dev ops.

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,310
So soon as you pass your developer or associate you will be able to go and sit the developer.

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,030
I would recommend however that you do sit ups administrators sociate first before going on to doing

37
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,260
the Devil's prayer.

38
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,580
If you're sick of that's vacations check out all platforms other great content including release Rudi's

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,080
may collapse and AWOS this week.

40
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,300
Yes remember that getting certified is just the first step in your journey to cloud AWOS changes all

41
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,340
the time and there are other clouds out there like as you and Google.

42
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,160
So it's really important to keep up and a great way to keep up on the go is by getting our mobile app.

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,160
It's available on the Apple app store as well as the Google Play store.

44
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,010
You'll be able to go ahead and watch all our content and you'll be able to download it and watch it

45
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,640
online so you don't need an internet connection.

46
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,290
