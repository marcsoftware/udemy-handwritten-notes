Hello clunkers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is going to introduce dynamo D.B. TTL.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,060
It's also known as dynamo D.B..

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,410
Time to Live.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,770
And this is a topic that has been coming up in the exams recently based on student feedback.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:21,810
So this lecture is going to just cover off TTL so you know exactly what it is for the exam.

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,790
So let's get started.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,760
So what is dynamo DB TTL.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,930
Well TTL or time to live.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:37,570
It's an attribute which defines an expiry time for your data so you define an expiry time and expired

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,750
items are automatically marked for deletion and once an item has been marked for deletion that means

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,670
it's going to be deleted within the next 48 hours.

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,370
And this is really good for removing any irrelevant or old data.

13
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,120
So data that's no longer useful to your application.

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:04,330
So think session data event logs any temporary data so any data that's no longer useful to your application.

15
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:10,870
After a certain period of time and this is going to really help to reduce costs for storing data in

16
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:16,060
dynamo IDB because it automatically removes data which you no longer need.

17
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,580
So the data is no longer relevant.

18
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,240
So it just does that housekeeping for you and automatically deletes the data.

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,870
So let's take a look at how that actually works within dynamo ADP.

20
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:32,830
And I've got an example session data table here so we're just storing the user I.D. such an idea session

21
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,620
creation time and the time to live.

22
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,570
And then finally the session data itself and the first thing you're probably going to notice is that

23
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,340
time to live is expressed in a pretty strange format.

24
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:50,830
It's expressed in the epoch time format and if you haven't heard of that before it's also known as Unix

25
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,430
time and it's also known as politics time as well.

26
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:00,430
And epoch time or Unix time or politics time that is a numerical value and it represents the number

27
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:06,540
of seconds which have elapsed since twelve a.m. on January the 1st 1970.

28
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:11,800
So even before I was born in fact a long time before I was born and probably a long time before a lot

29
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,320
of you were born as well.

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,350
So that is just the way that Unix systems see time and that's how they express time as a numerical value.

31
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:27,250
Now in this example I'm setting the expiration time on item and I'm setting it for two hours after the

32
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,410
session originally began.

33
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,820
And don't worry you can just use one of these really useful translation websites.

34
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,870
And I've got one to show you I'm just going to head over there now.

35
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,140
So this is the website I normally use is just called epoch converter.

36
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,540
I'm sure you can find one just by Googling or use your favorite one and you can just go in and set the

37
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:54,180
day set the hour to what you want to and then just translate it into an epoch timestamp.

38
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,940
So that's the kind of thing you can use if you are defining your TTL.

39
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:05,170
And it's this epoch time number which actually allows dynamo DP to easily compare your time to live

40
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,270
to the current time right now.

41
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:14,650
And in this example the expiration of this item is set for two hours after the session originally began.

42
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:21,760
And so when the current time is greater than the TTL the item is going to be expired and it gets marked

43
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,290
for deletion and then within the next 48 hours it's actually going to be deleted.

44
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,870
So that's actually quite a long window between being marked for deletion and actually getting deleted.

45
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:38,660
So in order to cater for that you can actually filter out any expired items from your queries and scans.

46
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,870
But let's take a look at how this actually works within the dynamo DB console.

47
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:50,410
But first of all we're going to need to create our own dynamo db table and I prepared a couple of commands

48
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,490
that we're going to run.

49
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:58,330
And before we do that you just need to make sure of course that your NWS CLIA is configured with credentials

50
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:04,860
of a user who has the correct permissions to go ahead and create dynamo DB tables.

51
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:13,800
So the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to type AWOL as I am get hyphen user and this is just going

52
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:20,940
to tell us which user we have used when we configured the IWC and I saw when we ran a s configure.

53
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,960
This is the user credentials that I used originally.

54
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:30,090
So I'm just gonna come back to my console and just double check the credentials of that particular user.

55
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:41,160
So I'm gonna go to services and then I am gonna find my user so it was FE and I'm just going to check

56
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,170
that that user has the correct permissions.

57
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,280
So my users actually got administrator access but if you don't have any dynamo DP access you don't if

58
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,990
you didn't have administrator access on that account then you can just go ahead and add permissions.

59
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:02,250
Go to attach existing policies and then just search for Dynamo DP and you can add dynamo IDB full access

60
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,930
to that user and that will make sure that you have access and to use dynamo DP.

61
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,820
So once you're happy with that I'm going to come back to the console and I've actually prepared a couple

62
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,340
of commands that were going to run.

63
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,510
So we're going to run one command to firstly create on your table and then we're going to run another

64
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,550
command to populate the table.

65
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,130
So I'll show you those commands before we run them.

66
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,930
And these are going to be included in a text file in the resources of the course.

67
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,620
So you'll be able to just copy and paste these.

68
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,820
So the first command is this one.

69
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,800
And this actually creates our session data table.

70
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,300
So first of all it runs the CREATE TABLE command.

71
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:46,110
It provides a table name of session data and then it defines our primary key which it calls it the hash

72
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,470
key.

73
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,880
And that's just an alternative name that they use for the primary key or the partition key.

74
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,750
So we're going to define our hash key as being the user I.D. and the attribute type is going to be of

75
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,880
type number.

76
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:03,330
And then finally the last thing we'd stipulate in this command is the provision throughput read capacity

77
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,200
units of five and write capacity units of five.

78
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,110
So you just copy that command and don't worry you don't need to understand all of the different options.

79
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,400
You don't need to understand the donor IDB commands the CLIA commands for the exam.

80
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,760
They're not going to test you on that.

81
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,440
It's just the quickest way to create the table for the purposes of this lecture.

82
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:29,250
So then just come back to the console and I'm just going to paste that into my console hit enter and

83
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,350
hopefully if that's been successful you should see this kind of output summarizing what we've done in

84
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:41,280
diner IDB and then the next command we're going to run is going to perform a batch right item and this

85
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,540
is going to write a number of items into our new table and it takes as input.

86
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:52,150
This this request items file which is going to be a file called items not Jason.

87
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,560
And you're going to need to download this from the resources section of the course.

88
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:03,570
So if I show you items not Jason it's simply a Jason File which is going to create these items in our

89
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,340
session data table.

90
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:10,500
So the first thing it does is it stipulates the name of the table which is set session data and then

91
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,490
it defines a number of put requests and the items that we're actually going to put into that table.

92
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,980
So we've got our user I.D. it's going to be a number this number here is the actual user I.D. then we've

93
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,980
got the session creation time expiration time and a session I.D. as well.

94
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,880
So it just creates three different items which it's going to put into the table.

95
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,010
So if we come back to our command just going to copy and paste that

96
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,880
okay and if that's successful we can come back to a console or we can just check whether that table

97
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:55,670
got created successfully so come to services dynamo DP and make sure that you are in the correct region

98
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,870
where you have run a W S configure.

99
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,450
So on my system

100
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:10,150
I mean us e 1 so I just need to make sure that I am looking at the U.S. e one region which I am and

101
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,140
then if we go to tables and there is our session data table.

102
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:20,130
So if you click on the table click on items and that should be the items that we have just populated.

103
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:26,380
So if that has run successfully for you you should have three items in your table with a user I.D. creation

104
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,170
time expiry time and a session I.D..

105
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,670
And I've just set this expiry time to midnight tonight and today is the 6th of December.

106
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:42,210
So I have set the expiration time for these items to be the 6th of December at midnight.

107
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:48,250
So you might want to update this set it to midnight tonight for whatever date it is when you are watching

108
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,270
this lecture.

109
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,490
So if you want to do that once again just go back to the Epoch converter and you can create an epoch

110
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,290
timestamp using whatever date you want to.

111
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:04,910
So let's say February the 2nd 2019 you can just configure the date that you want and then grab the epoch

112
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:11,170
timestamp and you can set it to whatever hour minute and second you want as well and set whatever the

113
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,660
local time is for wherever you are located.

114
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:20,250
So feel free to go in and update at expiration time if you want to follow along on this lecture.

115
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,850
So once you're happy with all of that we can actually go ahead and stop playing around with the time

116
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,090
to live for these items.

117
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:34,720
So if you had two actions click on manage TTL and the first thing it's going to ask you to do is define

118
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:41,740
which attribute you are basing the time to live on and we are going to be using this expiration time

119
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:48,060
as are TTL attributes so you need to just type in the name of your attribute

120
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:57,770
and dynamo D.B. actually allows you to preview TTL before you actually go ahead and apply it so we can

121
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:05,420
first of all we can run a preview based on previewing items expiring by 330 on today's date.

122
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,480
So I'm just going to run preview and that's what we should expect to see.

123
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,830
We shouldn't expect to see any items expiring by three thirty today because all of these items are set

124
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,780
to expire at midnight tonight.

125
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:31,670
So let's just change that to December the 7th and midnight and we can run the preview again and there

126
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,120
we are.

127
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:38,450
It should catch all three of those items because they are due to expire at midnight.

128
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:44,000
So if you want to go ahead and configure that time to lift all of these items you can hit continue.

129
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,430
And then if we go back to overview you should see under the table details of the time to live attribute.

130
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,830
It's configured as the attribute that we defined earlier.

131
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,790
So the expiration time.

132
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,180
So that is dynamo DB.

133
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,250
TTL.

134
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:04,130
The main thing to remember is that you can use it to define expiration times for your data.

135
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:09,970
It will mark your data for expiration as soon as the current time is greater than the TTL.

136
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,260
The item will then be expired marked for deletion and then deleted within 48 hours.

137
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,060
And just remember you can filter out the expired items from your queries and scans so that you don't

138
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,580
see them when you query and scan your data.

139
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,820
So that is everything you need to know about TTL.

140
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,470
If you have any questions please let me know.

141
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,890
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

142
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:31,900
Thank you.
