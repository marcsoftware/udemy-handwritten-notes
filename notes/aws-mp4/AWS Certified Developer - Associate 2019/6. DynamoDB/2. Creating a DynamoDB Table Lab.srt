00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:08,160
Hello clunkers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is gonna be a lab all about dynamo DP in

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,890
this lab we're going to create some dynamo DP tables using some p HP scripts which we're going to run

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,790
on an easy to instance and this instance is going to have a role assigned to it to enable it to interact

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,410
with Dynamo DP.

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,450
So if you're ready to get started please join me in the console and the first thing that I'm going to

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,670
do is create an identity access management role for our easy to instance.

7
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:40,270
So go ahead and find identity access management under security or then see compliance and we're gonna

8
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:50,050
go and click on roles and create role and it's going to be a service role for easy to so click on easy

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,120
to then hit next.

10
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,980
And we're going to select a policy type so click in the search box and we're going to just search for

11
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,130
Dynamo DP.

12
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:04,650
And I'm going to select dynamo DP full access click on Next.

13
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,920
And we need to give our role a name.

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,620
So I'm just going to call it dynamo DP and click on Create role so that's our role down here created.

15
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:22,240
And the next thing we need to do is go back to the dashboard go back to services and click on easy to

16
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:31,810
and click on launch instance and select the Linux I am I and we're just going to stay with the T2 micro

17
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,210
click on Next.

18
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,720
Most of these defaults we can just keep as the defaults but there's a couple of things that we need

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,710
to change.

20
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:46,500
So first of all we need to select our I am role that we just created so select dynamo DP and then on

21
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:54,370
the advance details we've got a bash script or a bootstrap script to add in here which is a script that's

22
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,360
gonna be run when the instance starts for the very first time.

23
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,070
So that is in the resources section but I've just got it copied so I'm just going to paste it in now

24
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:10,040
and all this script does is it just first of all it tells us it's using the bash interpreter it then

25
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:15,920
does a young update minus Y it then installs Apache HP and get as well.

26
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:23,420
It starts Apache and it makes sure that Apache will continue to start on boot up and then it changes

27
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:30,820
directory to var dub dub dub HMO and then it creates just a really simple test website.

28
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:37,040
And then finally it clones some code that we already have located in this get hub location.

29
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,920
So under get hub dot com a kangaroo dynamo DP.

30
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,010
So once you have cut and paste that and you'll just find this in the resources section of the course

31
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:54,120
you just copy and paste it in there then just hit on add storage next add tags and we're going to add

32
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:02,620
a tag tag we're going to add is name and then we're going to just call this one dynamo DP dynamo DBC

33
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:10,170
to click on Next and you want to select a security group which has both ATP and SS H.

34
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,480
So I've got this one here that I created for different lab and it allows ATP access via port 80 and

35
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,160
also SS H access.

36
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,870
So I'm going to select that one.

37
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,660
However if you don't have one you can go ahead and create a new security group.

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,250
Just click that button here but we don't need to do that.

39
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:35,510
I'm just going to select the one I already have here and then click on review and launch and then click

40
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:40,070
on launch and select an existing key pair for your region.

41
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,270
So I'm in the London Region so and I already have a key pair for London.

42
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,250
So I'm going to select that one again.

43
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,970
If you don't have one you can just click on Create new keeper and it will create one for you that you

44
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,220
can download.

45
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,780
I'm just gonna use the one that I already have and then click on launch instances.

46
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,400
And that might take a while so I'm just going to post the video now and come back when that has completed

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,530
and now here we are on the easy to dashboard and my instance has been launched.

48
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:15,890
So I just select the instance scroll down and find the public IP copy that's a clipboard.

49
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,110
And now I'm going to go to my terminal window

50
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,780
and I'm gonna type SS H minus I.

51
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,170
And then the name of my keeper.

52
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,050
Easy to dash user at.

53
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,350
And then paste in the IP address of your easy to instance and hit enter.

54
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,040
And then we are inside the easy to instance.

55
00:04:48,310 --> 00:05:00,390
So the first thing I'm gonna do is pseudo as you then seedy for dub dub dub HMO and hit Ellis and we

56
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,520
can see that a new directory has been created.

57
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:10,500
The Dynamo D.B. directory has been cloned from our get repository and there's also this test Doc P HP

58
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,100
file which is our Web page so the next thing that we need to do is we need to install the SDK for HP

59
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,220
and when we do that there's a couple of commands that we need to run.

60
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,740
First of all we need to get composer and then we need to use composer to install the latest version

61
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,980
of the SDK.

62
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,240
So I'm just gonna show you a web page which has those commands in it.

63
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:40,020
So this is the web page with the documentation for installing the w w SDK for P HP and the recommended

64
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:46,920
way for installing the SDK is to use composer which is a tool that manages and installs the dependencies

65
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,990
for installing HP.

66
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:55,170
So if we scroll down there is a link to the command line installation for compose it for Linux.

67
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,760
So we're installing this on our easy to instance so it's going to be the Linux installation.

68
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,680
So I'm just going to open up in a new tab and it gives us these four different commands that we need

69
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,900
to run to download the composer installer verify it then run the installer and then finally remove it.

70
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,460
And don't worry I'm going to add a text file with all of the commands that you need to run in order

71
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,250
to install composer and install CHP.

72
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,970
So that's going to be in the resources of the lecture.

73
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:28,200
So I'm just gonna start off by copying that first command and the first thing I'm going to do is type

74
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,680
pseudo askew and then I'm going to paste that command into my terminal window and a few students have

75
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,230
reported issues with their T2 micro server running out of memory when going through these steps to install

76
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:46,170
composer AMP BHP and unfortunately we haven't been able to replicate the problem on our side so we can't

77
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,270
really explain why that might be happening.

78
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:53,530
However if you do experience memory issues when trying to run this set of commands I've added a work

79
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:59,250
around that one of our students who experience the issue has kindly provided which just creates a swap

80
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,860
file and it should hopefully fix any memory issues that you are experiencing.

81
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:09,750
Just go ahead and run these three commands and they are in the resources section of the course and then

82
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,130
you should be able to continue.

83
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:18,840
So now I'm gonna come back to my Web page and grab the second command and paste that copy our third

84
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:25,300
command and paste then copy the fourth command

85
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,000
and paste.

86
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:36,240
Just gonna clear the screen come back to our page and so we've downloaded and installed composer.

87
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,830
So the next thing that we need to do is run this command as well.

88
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,630
And this is just going to install HP.

89
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,910
So grab that and paste that into a window.

90
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:53,610
And it does.

91
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,810
Just take a few seconds but if it's successful you should see a similar response to this.

92
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:06,070
So now that has completed let's just run less and we're going to change directory into the dynamo DP

93
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:13,030
directory and you can see there's two different files in here two different BHP files.

94
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:19,000
So there's one called create tables and that's that file is that script is going to create a bunch of

95
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,880
tables in our dynamo DP.

96
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:28,380
And the second one is called upload data and that's going to upload some data into those tables.

97
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,440
Now the first thing that we need to do is we just need to make an update into this create tables dot

98
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,460
BHP to make sure that we're installing our tables in the correct region.

99
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,490
So I'm just going to open that up now

100
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:52,180
and you'll want to come down where you see this section here where it specifies the region and at the

101
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,160
moment mine is set to EU West 1.

102
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,950
So what you need to do is replace that with whatever region you're working from so whichever region

103
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,040
you're running the easy to instance in.

104
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,730
That's the region that you want to specify here.

105
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,210
So if I come back to my console I'm in London.

106
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,210
So that means I'm going to have to change my region because London is a ust to too.

107
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,220
Actually you can see it down here as well you west to a.

108
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,830
So that's for the availability zone but the region is EU West too.

109
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:26,750
So that means I need to go back and change that in my BHP file so I'm going to come across here and

110
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:35,760
replace that with two and then save and then we are done with that file and now we also need to make

111
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,940
the same update in the upload data dot BHP

112
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:50,760
and again scroll down until you find region and come across and just replace that with your desired

113
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,860
region and save.

114
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
And now we are done with those two files.

115
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,020
So it's really important to make sure you change the region and you change it in both files otherwise

116
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,290
the lab will not work and the next thing we're going to do is come back to our console window and I'm

117
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:11,420
gonna go into dynamo DP now and just show you this is the splash screen that you should see if you don't

118
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,370
have any dynamo DB tables created already.

119
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,000
So that moment we've got nothing here.

120
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:25,140
So I'm gonna go back into my AC to instance go and find the public IP for that instance select for instance

121
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:32,010
and just copy that to clipboard then I'm going to open a new tab on my browser paste the IP in on your

122
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:41,500
browser tab and then just hit slash dynamo DP and then the name of create tables dot BHP

123
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:52,900
and then hit enter so this is just gonna run that BHP script to create some tables within dynamo DP

124
00:10:52,930 --> 00:11:01,600
for us and it just takes a few moments to complete okay and we just got the response now just saying

125
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,850
it's created a table for the product catalog forum thread and reply.

126
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:12,610
So it's created four tables for us and now the next thing we need to do is we need to run that BHP script

127
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,200
to upload data into our tables.

128
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:21,790
So just come back to your browser window and we can just modify it and delete the create tables and

129
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:27,850
just replace that with upload data and then just hit enter.

130
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,410
So it's adding data into the product catalogue forum and reply table now.

131
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:36,760
So it says that's finished so let's go back into the console and see what it's put in the tables for

132
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,490
us.

133
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,520
So come back to services and dynamo DP

134
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:51,310
click on tables and you can say is created these four different tables for us.

135
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,450
So let's take a look at the product catalog table for example click on items

136
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,980
and we can see the upload data.

137
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:10,270
HP has populated our table with a load of different items and we've got here a product I.D. a price

138
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,520
category title type brand color etc..

139
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,420
I just noticed that not all items have every single attribute and that's one of the great things about

140
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,290
dynamo DP is that you don't have to have everything.

141
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,310
It's very flexible.

142
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,750
Not every item has to have the same type or number of attributes.

143
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:37,690
And just notice here that you can either query and you can query based on a product I.D. for example

144
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,580
and we can enter a value here.

145
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:47,170
So for example if I enter valued I enter 1 0 2 here click on Start search it will search for an item

146
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:53,830
in our table with the product catalog ideas of 1 0 2 and then you can also run a scan as well which

147
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:59,020
will just show us everything in the table if we click on spot search for that it will just show us absolutely

148
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:05,650
everything in the table and there's just one more thing that I want to show you which is how to interact

149
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,720
with our database using the command line.

150
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,040
So I'm gonna come back to my terminal window now.

151
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:19,620
So I'm back in my terminal session on my easy to instance and I can actually use the AWB US command

152
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,030
line interface to query the database programmatically.

153
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:31,240
And remember we created the identity access management role to give this instance dynamo DP full access

154
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,790
so it should be able to connect to our database and make queries.

155
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,530
Now I already have the command in my clipboard so I'm just going to paste it now and this command simply

156
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:50,860
uses the AWB CLIA to talk to dynamo DP and to run a get item operation on the table name called product

157
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:56,980
catalog and the region is going to be EU West too because that's where my dynamo DB table is located

158
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,070
and the key is specified here.

159
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:06,730
So that's the partition key and the partition key is an I.D. and the value is the numerical value and

160
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:15,760
the value is 2 0 5 so I'm searching the diagram IDB table for product with the product I.D. of 2 0 5.

161
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:22,810
So I'm going to hit enter and that has queried the table and it's brought up that product item and this

162
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:29,660
is all enabled by the identity access management role which has given us full access to dining IDB.

163
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:39,970
So if I go back to the console and go into services and then back into identity access management and

164
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:48,100
I'm going to go into that role the tiny IDB Ro and I'm going to delete that permission

165
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,080
and I'm actually going to delete the roll

166
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,050
so now that role doesn't exist for our easy to instance anymore.

167
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,890
So let's go back to the instance and see if we can still run that database command.

168
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,950
So I'm just going to hit up arrow and try and run the command again.

169
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,660
There you go.

170
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:15,310
So the security token included in the request is invalid and it's not letting us access our table.

171
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,820
So just remember if you want your easy two instances to be able to access your dynamo DB tables to be

172
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,220
able to query them and insert items into them they need to have that identity access management service

173
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,730
role to allow them access to the database

174
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,180
so that it's dynamo DP.

175
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:40,820
And we just created some tables and populated them with some data so that you're able to now manipulate

176
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:46,640
that data and run queries and searches etc. and this will really help you as you progressed through

177
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,020
this section of the course and it will really help you to get a little bit more familiar with Dynamo

178
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,270
DP and how it all works.

179
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,490
So that is the end of this lecture hopefully that all worked for you if you have any questions please

180
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,340
let me know.

181
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,360
If not please feel free to move on to the next lecture.

182
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,840
Thank you.
