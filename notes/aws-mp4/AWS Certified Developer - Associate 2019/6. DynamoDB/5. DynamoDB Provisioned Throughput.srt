Hello Cokers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is all about dynamite D-B provisioned throughput

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,350
and proficient throughput is the mechanism that we use to define the capacity and performance requirements

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,670
in Don MIDP.

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,680
So let's get started.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:28,030
So does deep a previsions Reaper is measured in capacity units and when you create your table assuming

6
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:34,780
you're not using auto scaling you need to specify your requirements in terms of reach capacity units

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:43,230
and right capacity units and one right capacity unit is equal to 1 1 kilobyte per second.

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:52,600
And one real capacity unit is equal to 1 strongly consistent read of four kilobytes per seconds or two

9
00:00:52,690 --> 00:01:00,140
eventually consistent rates of four kilobytes per second and eventually consistent reads all the default.

10
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,610
So let's have a look at an example configuration.

11
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:10,330
So think of a table with five read capacity units and five right capacity units configured.

12
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:18,190
And this configuration will be able to perform 5 4 kilobytes strongly consistent rates which equals

13
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,010
20 kilobytes per second.

14
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,890
It will be able to perform twice as many eventually consistent rates per second.

15
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,430
So that would be 40 kilobytes per second.

16
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:36,160
And it will be able to perform 5 1 kilobyte bytes per second which equals five kilobytes per second.

17
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:44,470
Now if your application reads or writes large items is going to consume more capacity units and it will

18
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:51,460
cost you more as well because the price goes up the more read and write capacity units you are provisioning.

19
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,950
So lets have a look at how we calculate the requirements how we work out how many read or write capacity

20
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,580
units you're going to need full application.

21
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:06,810
So I imagine you have an application and it needs to read 80 items or table rows per second.

22
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:14,740
And each item is three kilobytes in size and you need strongly consistent rates.

23
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,800
First of all you need to calculate how many read capacity units are needed for each rate.

24
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,490
So the way we do that is we take the size of each item and divide it by four kilobytes.

25
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,000
So 3 divided by four is 0.75.

26
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,750
Round that up to the nearest whole number.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,050
So h Reid is going to need one read capacity unit per read operation and then we simply multiply that

28
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,060
by the number of rates per second.

29
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,600
So in this case 80 rates per second.

30
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:52,670
So thats going to be 80 read capacity units required for strongly consistent rates but what about eventually

31
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,690
consistent rates.

32
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,350
Well you do exactly the same calculation.

33
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:03,020
However as this is eventually consistent rates and you get to 4 kilobyte rates per second with eventually

34
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,310
consistent which is double the three strongly consistent.

35
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,420
Just take your calculations for the strongly consistent rates and you can just divide it by two.

36
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:19,190
So we take the size of each item divided by four kilobytes three divided by four point seventy five

37
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,040
rounded up to the nearest whole number is 1.

38
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,940
Then multiply that by the number of raids per second is 80.

39
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,930
Divide it by two because you get double the three put provincially consistent.

40
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,190
So that means you only need 40 read capacity units for eventually consistent reads.

41
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,380
For this example but what's about right capacity units.

42
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:49,120
Well just imagine you want to write 100 items per second in your table and H item is 512 bytes in size.

43
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,270
So firstly you would calculate how many capacity units are needed for each.

44
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,070
Right.

45
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:04,630
So the size of each item divided by 1 kilobyte for right capacity units so that's 512 bytes divided

46
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:12,480
by 1 kilobytes equals zero point five round that up to the nearest whole number.

47
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:20,140
So each rights will need one right writes capacity unit per write operation and then multiply that by

48
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,280
the number of rights per second.

49
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:29,960
So that's 100 white capacity units required in this example.

50
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,640
So let's have a look at some of our exam tips.

51
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,490
So it's really important to understand read and write capacity units.

52
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,890
And it's important to know how to do those calculations as well because if you do get asked in the exam

53
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,050
it will be really easy marks if you know how to do the calculation.

54
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:54,150
So just remember provisional throughput is measured in capacity units one right capacity unit is 1 1

55
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,820
kilobyte right per second.

56
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:05,370
One read capacity unit is one for kilobyte strongly consistent rate or two for kilobyte eventually consistent

57
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,140
reads per second.

58
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,890
So that is the end of this lecture.

59
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,160
As I said it's really important to understand how to do those calculations.

60
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,630
So it's definitely worth doing our quizzes and doing our tests and making sure that you fully understand

61
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,700
how to do those relations.

62
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,260
But if you have any questions please let me know.

63
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,770
If not please feel free to move on to the next lecture.

64
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,280
Thank ye.
