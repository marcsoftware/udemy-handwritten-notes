Hello cloggers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is going to be all about dynamite.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,910
DP index's So let's get started.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,420
So what is an index.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:18,240
Well in stinko databases an index is a data structure which allows you to perform really fast queries

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,780
on specific columns within a table and you can select the columns that you're interested in that you

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,710
want to include in that index.

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,720
And then you run your searches against that index rather than on the entire data set.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,860
So it really makes your queries much more efficient.

9
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:44,700
And in talking about DP There are two types of index supported to help speed up your dynamo IDB queries.

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,670
Now don't try IDB.

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:52,330
Of course it's not a sequel database but it does still have this index feature and Entine of ODP.

12
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:59,590
There are two types of index that are supported which will both help speed up your dynamo DB queries.

13
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:06,210
So firstly we have the local secondary index and also the global secondary index.

14
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,900
So let's take a look at these in a little bit more detail.

15
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:17,540
Now a local secondary index is an index that can only be created when you are creating your table.

16
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:26,410
So you cannot add remove or modify it later and it has the same partition key as your original table

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,930
but it does have a different sort key.

18
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,320
And that's what gives you the different view on your data because your data is going to be organized

19
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,090
according to an alternative sort.

20
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:44,260
Any queries that are based on this sort key that you run against the local secondary index are then

21
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,710
much faster than they would be if you were using the mind table.

22
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:54,040
So for example in a customer table where you're storing all information about your customers their e-mail

23
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,980
address all of that all the purchases they've made all their contact details et cetera you might have

24
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:06,280
a local secondary index which uses the main partition of user ID and then uses a different sort caid

25
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,820
to your main table.

26
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,990
So you might use a sort key like account creation date.

27
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:19,060
Now for global secondary indexes these are much much more flexible so you can create the global secondary

28
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,000
index whenever you like.

29
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:27,020
So you can either create it when you create your table or you can add it later on and it allows you

30
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:33,010
to choose a different partition key as well as a different sort key to your main table.

31
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,530
So that gives you a completely different view of the data.

32
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,220
And of course it speeds up any queries that are relating to this alternative partition.

33
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,500
And so key.

34
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:49,400
So for example in our customer table we might want to create a global secondary index using a different

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,560
partition of email address and then use a sort of last log in date.

36
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,880
So what are exam tips for the dynamite IDB indexes.

37
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:06,480
Well firstly indexes overall enable much faster queries but only on very specific data columns that

38
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,970
give you a different view with your data based on an alternative partition key or an alternative partition

39
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,730
key and an automotive Souci.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,970
And it's really important to understand the differences between these two types of index.

41
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:24,870
So just remember for the local secondary index it must be created when you create your table and it

42
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,880
uses the same partition but a different sort key.

43
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:35,300
And for the global secondary index you can create it anytime either at table creation or afterwards.

44
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,560
And it can have a different position key as well as a different sort key.

45
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,760
So that's the end of this lecture.

46
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,010
If you have any questions please let me know.

47
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,080
If not please feel free to move on to the next section.
