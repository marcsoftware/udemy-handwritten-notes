R.k Hello cloggers and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,500
So hopefully you're enjoying the course so far.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,320
You are Fareway into it by now and you are learning an awful lot about AWOS Hopefully you're enjoying

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,190
it as well.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,220
What does that tell you about a competition we run every single week.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,050
It's called gure of the week.

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:21,690
What we do is we post a professional level questions are really really hard question each week to our

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:27,060
Facebook page and what you can do is click through and go and answer that question on our discussion

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,640
forums each week what we do is we choose one.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,090
And so that's correct.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,950
And also that has the best explanation as well.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,620
And what we do is we then send an exclusive Taisha.

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,250
So this is the T-shirt here.

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,110
Seriously I don't even own one of these.

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,510
It's only for when is of the week you get a sticker and you get a hand signed card by me and you also

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,620
go into the draw to win a free ticket to reinvent for 2018.

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,820
This will give you lots of practice for answering professional level questions.

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,850
So if you do want to go on and do your professional certifications this is a great way to practice as

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,370
well.

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,860
And it's completely free to enter.

21
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,600
And like I said you can win really awesome prizes and a free ticket to re-invent 20:18.

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,100
So make sure you check it out.

23
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,720
We announce the winner every single week on our weekly TV show AWOS this week.

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,880
So that's it for me guys.

25
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,410
Awesome I'll see in the next lecture.
