00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,520
Hello loggers and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,110
This is one of my favorite lectures and in this lecture we're gonna go ahead and create our own Alexis

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,000
skill.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:13,950
Well we're going to use the AWB as polished service to go in and basically transcribe our notes into

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,240
MP 3 files.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,250
We're going to host these empty three files in S. three and then we're going to use Alexa to stream

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,780
our MP three files and we'll be using the service application repository.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,430
Now this is all very hands on.

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,810
So it's going to teach you how to use the service application repository and how easy it is to build

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,160
out Alexis skills so hopefully have an awful lot of fun.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,420
Before we go on to the lecture let's just have a look at how Alexa works.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,090
So this is an Amazon Echo.

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,630
Amazon Echo is the name of the hardware for Alexa and essentially you just go in and you say to your

14
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:53,450
echo Alexa turn on welcome home or Alexa turn on my chill music or Alexa turn on the TV et cetera.

15
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:59,220
Now in terms of the way it works I'd like to use the example of an iPhone and an iPhone as the hardware.

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,110
Siri is the voice service.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,980
So with your Amazon Echo that is the actual physical hardware and Alexa is the voice service.

18
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,850
So that is the way it works.

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,120
So sometimes people use echo and Alexa interchangeably but technically speaking Echo is the hardware

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,450
and Amazon Alexa is the voice service and you can also change the hardware up so you can use Raspberry

21
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,570
Pi as you can use here at Amazon Echo.

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,590
You can use Amazon Fire TV we've got echo dots we've got echo shows and basically the hardware is becoming

23
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,740
more and more prevalent so you can have multiple different devices but they're all using the same voice

24
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:45,030
service they're all sending information to the aid of U.S. cloud and NWS uses automatic speech recognition

25
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,770
and natural lung language understanding to translate what you're saying in to text.

26
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:56,130
So it's doing a text to speak translation and essentially what this is then going on is to do is to

27
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,740
go on and trigger a lambda function so literally every single time you use the Amazon Echo in your home

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,420
you are speaking directly to lambda and lambda is talking back to you.

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,810
So in terms of how we actually go and build out our skills we always start with Lambda.

30
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:17,040
So we go in and create our lambda function so going to be using the surplus application repository.

31
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,100
And sometimes this is referred to as the skills service.

32
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,850
So this is one half of our of creating our skill.

33
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,990
Then we have to go in and configure the skill interface and this is where we can figure things like

34
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,430
invocation names intent schemas slot types utterances et cetera.

35
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,260
Now we're only going to do this once and it's beyond the scope of this course in order to learn how

36
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:37,970
to do all this.

37
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:43,260
And we do have some Alexa courses on the a cloud guru platform and we will have a certification course

38
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,090
coming out on the a cloud platform because there is a new Alexa specialty cert.

39
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,690
So let's go ahead and get started and log into the adobe s console.

40
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:51,890
Okay.

41
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,120
So here we are in the adobe asset management console.

42
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,130
The first thing we want to do is just go ahead and create an S3 Buckets.

43
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,730
So we're gonna go ahead and create a bucket.

44
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,620
I'm going to call it a cloud guru.

45
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,730
Polly 2019 something like that and I'm gonna go ahead and hit create and that already exists.

46
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,020
So call it a cloud guru.

47
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,760
Polly assets 2019 and go ahead and hit create.

48
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,110
And that has now created my bucket in here I'm going to click in here I'm gonna go edit my public access

49
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,550
settings.

50
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,660
So we do want to make this bucket public.

51
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,270
So I'm gonna go ahead and just type confirm and then we're gonna go and give it a bucket policy making

52
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,860
everything inside it public.

53
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,080
So it's click in here go to our permissions and go to our bucket policy and this will be available in

54
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,570
the resources section of the course.

55
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,230
Just go ahead and copy that into your clipboard and then we're gonna paste it in here and then we're

56
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,560
just going to change the resource a r n.

57
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,110
And we're gonna grab our R and from here.

58
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:51,510
So just copy that into your clipboard and then go over to here and paste it in and go ahead and hit

59
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:57,330
save straight away you'll be able to see that the UI has changed saying hey everything in this bucket

60
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,490
is now public.

61
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,320
So going to use this bucket to store our MP three files and we're going to basically take some notes

62
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,370
and then generate MP three files using the poly service.

63
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,370
So go ahead and copy that into your clipboard.

64
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,570
This is the R N for the bucket.

65
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,940
Actually you just need the bucket name.

66
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,150
I don't think you need the IRS and so just copy the bucket name into your clipboard.

67
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,190
And then what we're gonna do I'm gonna go over to services and we're going to go down and find the poly

68
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:29,370
service so the poly service can be found on a machine learning and you'll see Amazon poly in here and

69
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,020
in here we can go and listen to this.

70
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:38,050
Now I don't know if you're gonna be able to hear this but I will read any text you typed here and put

71
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,210
in any text and will play it out.

72
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,960
So I'm going to because I'm Australian.

73
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,430
I'm gonna go over to Australia and I like Russell so I'm going to put Russell in here and then what

74
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,790
I want you to do is just paste some notes in here.

75
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,650
Among the easy to landing page you can write your own notes.

76
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,850
I'm just gonna copy this into my clipboard and go back over here in a paste this in here.

77
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,810
So we've basically is just saying Amazon's elastic compute cloud easy to as a web service that provides

78
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,020
I'm not going to read the whole thing too and then what I'm going to do is going to go down and clicked

79
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:15,560
synthesize to S S3 and in here I'm gonna type in my bucket name so it's a cloud guru Polly assets 2019

80
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,170
and I'm just going to maximise this and I'm gonna go ahead and hit synthesize and so that has now created

81
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,640
a task to synthesize this text into an MP 3 file and if we go down to our S3 synthesis tasks you'll

82
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,800
be able to see here that one is scheduled and this is one that I did earlier and that has had has now

83
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,510
completed.

84
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,750
So it does take a little bit of time can take a couple of minutes if you just hit refresh.

85
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,490
They actually took only a few seconds so that has now completed the task.

86
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:50,270
If we go back over to S3 we'll be able to see that MP 3 file which is sitting in our public bucket and

87
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,620
there it is there.

88
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,510
Now what we want to do is create an Alexis skill that will start playing these MP three files so you'll

89
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:02,900
be basically be able to say hey Alexa open study buddy or something like that and then it will read

90
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,050
you out a random AWP as fact.

91
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,970
So help you be able to study.

92
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,780
So let's go over to services and what we're gonna do is we're gonna go over to lambda and we're gonna

93
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,040
go and create a lambda function.

94
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,810
Now I would do this in Northern Virginia if I was you.

95
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,540
You need to do this in a region where the Alexa's triggers are enabled and they're only in certain regions

96
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,940
or around the world.

97
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,590
I think it's definitely Northern Virginia and Ireland.

98
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:32,210
I think there's one in Sydney but basically you need to do it in a region where the Alexa trigger is

99
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,050
enabled.

100
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,640
So I'm gonna do this in Northern Virginia.

101
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,650
I'm gonna go ahead and create my function.

102
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:42,320
Now you could go over to blueprints and type in Alexa but if you do that you'll see that they all say

103
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,690
please use the Alexa skills no James fax skill from the service application repository and just says

104
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,040
that for most of these skills.

105
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,130
So let's use the service application repository and these are basically service applications published

106
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,920
by AWB as well as Adobe as partners and other developers and you can just use them for free.

107
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,830
You don't need to know how to go ahead and program.

108
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,860
You can see this today.

109
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,320
Right now there's 434.

110
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,790
And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use the Alexa skills kit.

111
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,300
No J.S. fax skills.

112
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,830
We're gonna select this one.

113
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,460
And then what we're going to do is we're going to just leave everything as default.

114
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,310
And here we've got our permissions we don't need to really do anything here.

115
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,310
So we're just gonna go ahead and hit deploy and this will deploy our Alexis skill to lambda and then

116
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:34,560
that's it really what we need is the HRN and then we can go ahead and connect this up to the developer

117
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,260
dot Amazon.com.

118
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,390
So in here you can see your applications being deployed you go ahead and click on lambda.

119
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,890
Right now I've got zero lambda functions I would if I go back and just go back into lambda or you could

120
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:52,040
just refresh a page eventually you'll see that the service has been deployed and then we go that has

121
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,320
now been deployed and this is basically I think it's probably using cloud formation to deploy this out.

122
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,210
So let's go ahead and click in here and we'll be able to see our functions and you can see that we've

123
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,940
got the Alexis skills kit as a trigger so that's because this region supports the Alexis skills kit

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,280
as a trigger we scroll down to our IDC we'll be able to see our code.

125
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,030
Now you can go in and customize this.

126
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,890
Essentially this is the message that's going to read out.

127
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,640
So it's here's your fact and then it will this is your help message.

128
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,620
So if you get stuck it will say hey you can tell me a space fact et cetera et cetera.

129
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,700
This is a reprint.

130
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,780
So basically if you invoke the skill and then you just stay silent or say hey what can I help you with.

131
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,440
And then when you say stop it or say goodbye.

132
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,880
And these are your facts here.

133
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,610
So it's randomly going to choose one of these lines and it is completely random and you can add more.

134
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,520
Just make sure that you use these.

135
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,600
You basically use this exact format.

136
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,860
You can go in here and go copy and then you just add it to the very bottom.

137
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:59,330
You go paste and then let's just add my name as a random fact and we actually use this for all kinds

138
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,580
of purposes like if we have a raffle we just put people's names in.

139
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,410
So in fact in AWB this week we have competitions at the end of every week.

140
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,050
And basically if you answer a really hard question on our Facebook page you could win guru of the week

141
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:18,440
guru of the week is where you get a free sticker hand side card and T-shirt out to you on the post and

142
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,930
then you're in the draw to win a free ticket to reinvent and at the when we do the draw for reinvent

143
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:29,600
we use this exact skill and we just put every single person's name in here as different line.

144
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,740
And then we ask Alexa to pick one.

145
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,130
And that's how we draw the winner to reinvent.

146
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,000
So it is complete random.

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,490
So we use this skill personally as well.

148
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,080
So that is it.

149
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,730
I'm just gonna go ahead and hit save.

150
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,880
And so that has now saved our skill.

151
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,670
And the only thing you really need to take note of is our HRN.

152
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,930
We're going to need that.

153
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:55,350
So you just hit that icon and you're gonna need that to be able to create your skill so need you to

154
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,960
go over to developer dot Amazon dot com.

155
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,790
Now just sign up for a developer account.

156
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:06,060
If you do have an Alexa device make sure you use the same email that is registered to your Alexa device

157
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:11,700
because then you'll be able to literally use the skills straight away to go over to develop it at Amazon.com.

158
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,450
OK so I've signed into developer dot Amazon.com.

159
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,610
I'm gonna go ahead and hit on Amazon Alexa.

160
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,550
I got to click up here and go over to my skills.

161
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,610
I'm gonna go into my Alexa console and I'm gonna go go ahead and create a skill.

162
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,100
And what's really cool is we can get this skill a name so call it my study buddy something like that.

163
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,550
My study buddy the default language if you are in the UK or Australia or wherever.

164
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,010
Make sure you change this to match the default language on your Alexa device.

165
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:45,720
So if you are using the Australian one or the UK one change it if you want to keep everything simple.

166
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,000
Change your Alexa over to us.

167
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,400
English US.

168
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,820
I'm gonna leave this as default.

169
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:57,990
My Lexa is on English us and then we're just going to do custom and self hosted so that's already selected

170
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:03,630
so all you need to do is click up here and go create skill that will then go ahead and create our skill

171
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,730
and what's really cool is you can choose a template and we've already used the service application repository

172
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,480
for a fact skill and in here we just need to click on this.

173
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,420
That's it.

174
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,590
Go ahead and hit choose.

175
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,990
It is seriously that simple in here.

176
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,190
This is the Alexa development console.

177
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:23,880
Again if you want to learn more about this we do have an entire course on Alexa in here we've got the

178
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,720
invocation.

179
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,110
So what's the invocation name right now says space facts.

180
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,730
I'm gonna call a cloud layer less to cloud facts something like that.

181
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,080
That might be easy.

182
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,120
And then we're gonna go down and we're going to go ahead and save our model before we build our model.

183
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,860
The only other thing we need to do is go to our end point and inhere.

184
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:50,820
This is where we give our our skill the R in the lambda a R N so just pasted in there.

185
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,740
And so this is basically pointing our skill to our lambda function.

186
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,410
Once you've done that hits save endpoints then go back over to your get new fact intent.

187
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,310
You don't need to add anything in here but these are your sample utterances.

188
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:11,370
So you say hey Alexa ask cloud facts a fact or a space fact we might want to change this to a cloud

189
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:11,760
factor.

190
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,740
In fact let's add that in a cloud fact and gonna hit plus and that adds it to our utterances.

191
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,550
So an utterance is just a way of saying something is going to go ahead and save our model and then we're

192
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,500
gonna go ahead and build our model.

193
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,880
Now the build will take a little bit of time.

194
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,620
I'm just gonna pause the video because it takes a couple of minutes but as soon as it's built you will

195
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,420
see a little notification down here saying that it's done and you can see down here that the build is

196
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,770
now successful.

197
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,620
I could go over to test.

198
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:45,030
I should be able to test this and we're just going to turn the test on to development and that will

199
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:50,480
allow us to test and then what we can do is say open cloud facts.

200
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,000
I think it's cloud fact.

201
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,740
Let's have a look.

202
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,250
Here's your fact.

203
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,380
Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planet so it is definitely working.

204
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,370
And over here you can see this is the input and then this is the output.

205
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,650
This is our lambda function talking back to us.

206
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:11,660
And you can see that it has speak so sort of like h t Mellon that it's actually called SSA SS AML which

207
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,990
stands for synthesis speech markup language so to speak.

208
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,870
Here's your fact.

209
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,670
Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planets and it got that from our lambda function.

210
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:27,060
If we go back over here what we can do is we can just go through and delete all these other facts.

211
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,350
So if I just go in and delete that so I've only got one fact.

212
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:37,620
Now if I hit save and then I go back over to my developer console sorry it's over here and I say let's

213
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,960
open cloud fact again and should just read out my now.

214
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,750
Word.

215
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,850
Now we go it just read out my name.

216
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:53,100
So the last thing we want to do is we want to essentially point our fact to our S3 Buckets to our MP

217
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:59,530
3 file that Polly just generated so to do that let's go over to services and we'll go over to S3 and

218
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,340
then all you want to do is click on the bucket.

219
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,360
So a cloud guru.

220
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,700
Polly assets click in here and just grab this.

221
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,450
You are allowed to copy that into your clipboard.

222
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:14,590
Then we want to go back over to our lambda function and we're just gonna go in here and we're going

223
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,080
to add one little edit.

224
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:21,150
So in here if we scroll all the way down just scroll up so it's easy to see.

225
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,450
We've got we've got our data in here.

226
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:31,190
So instead of saying Ryan Kronenberg let's go ahead and paste our link in here now to make it talk.

227
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,380
You can see there's an example here.

228
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,170
So it's audio see and then the link.

229
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,270
This is a super useful reference guide to doing stuff with Alexis I'm gonna leave this in the resources

230
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,690
section of the course.

231
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:50,440
I've got our Euro in here or we now need to do is go audio and then source then equals and we're gonna

232
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:58,560
do our double quotations and then a forward slash sorry backslash and then we go all the way to the

233
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:05,070
end and then another backslash and then end quotations and then forward slash and then close it out.

234
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:10,070
And so then we're gonna go ahead and hit save and that is now save let's go ahead and test this.

235
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:17,370
So if we go over to here we can go in and just say open cloud fact and hit enter.

236
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,620
And that's there we go.

237
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,520
Russell's reading it out in a Australian accent.

238
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,490
I'm just going to mute it but it is now playing our facts so you can go and use police service to output

239
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:37,750
all your notes to your S3 bucket and then you can basically so long as you map back the empty threes

240
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:44,950
here as it as a individually New Line your Alexis skill then read this out to you and to open this up

241
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:51,080
in your developer account or you need to do is use the invocations you just need to say Alexa open cloud

242
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,600
fact.

243
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,830
So that is it for this lecture everyone.

244
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,300
I hope you had an awful lot of fun.

245
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,460
Like I said on the cloud guru platform we have heaps of different videos to show you how to build all

246
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,900
kinds of different Alexis skills so make sure you check it out in the next lecture early on to go ahead

247
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,940
and have a look at Adobe a step function.

248
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,150
So if you've got the time please join me in the next lecture.

249
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,540
Thank you.
