1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,090
OK hello cloggers and welcome to the second last lecture in this section of the course it is going to

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,490
be the last lab we are going to learn all about AWOS x ray.

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,570
So what is x ray.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,670
Basically it's a service that collects data about your requests that your application serves and it

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,400
provides you with tools you can use to view filter and gain insights into that data to identify issues

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,830
and opportunities for optimization.

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,670
So basically it's a way of visualizing your survivalist list application.

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,950
You can see where your performance bottlenecks.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,990
What's causing it to run slow and how you could potentially go in and fix it all just generally what's

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,950
going wrong if it's not working for any trace requests to your application.

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,350
You can see detailed information not only about the request and the response but also about calls that

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:53,930
your application makes to downstream AWOS resources Micro's services databases as well as HTP web API.

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,180
So let's have a look at how it works.

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,600
Let's have a look at the architecture.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,240
So you've got to have your application and you're going to have the AWOS X-Rite SDK stored inside your

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,100
application.

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:12,630
And basically this SDK sends bits of Jason to the X-ray daemon and this X-Rite daemon can be installed

18
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,130
on Linux PCs Windows PCs as well as OSX.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,690
And essentially what it does is it's listening on UDP and it takes this Jason and then sends it over

20
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:29,370
to the x ray API and then the x ray API basically stores all this data and then creates the x rays sort

21
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,710
of visualization which you see off to the right.

22
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,790
So we can see here we've got our web app we've got our API So here's our API here.

23
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,200
And then here our our resources inside our applications.

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,130
So these are all his school keep a user and we'll go and have a look at this when we do the lab.

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,330
So this is one Dynamite's a big table.

26
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,310
This is another dynamo IDB table.

27
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,390
This is another dynamo D-B table.

28
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,230
Over here we've got an S and S Q et cetera and we can see when what's happening when our users are interacting

29
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,000
with the API.

30
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:07,460
We can see all the different micro services and we can see the actual time that it takes.

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,370
So we got 27 milliseconds here 25 milliseconds here.

32
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,160
This one is taking 20 and ninety nine milliseconds to write to the database.

33
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,000
So that's basically how it works.

34
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,580
We also then have our scripts and tools.

35
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:26,210
So this could be the normal process DKs as well as the CLIA and they communicate either with the date

36
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,740
daemon or with the X-ray API directly.

37
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:35,430
So in terms of the SDK it provides you with three things it provides you with interceptors to add to

38
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:42,330
your code to trace incoming Hastey to request client handlers to instrument A.W. SSD case clients that

39
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:48,900
your application uses to call other AWOS services and a database client to use to instrument calls to

40
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,590
other internal and external hate CTP Web services.

41
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,990
So in terms of integration it actually integrates with the following services so you can have it with

42
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:03,270
elastic load balances with Lamda with API gateway with easy to and with elastic beanstalk.

43
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,820
We're going to be using beanstalk to deploy our app in this part of the lab.

44
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,330
Just be aware of what languages are supported by X right.

45
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,500
Basically every language that supported by lambda.

46
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,930
So we've got Java go.

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,100
No gyrus Python Ruby and dot net.

48
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,250
Those are the current languages supported by X-ray.

49
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,300
OK so the easiest way to learn about X-rays to get our hands dirty so you'll need to go to this link

50
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,950
we have linked it in the resources section but just go to console AWOS to Amazon Dot com for special

51
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,640
lastic things stalk photo slash number and import slash new application.

52
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:43,020
And then we just want to you posit some data so that the application name is school cape and the solutions

53
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,540
Steck name is Java so you can click on that link.

54
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,070
We should be ready to go.

55
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,360
OK so here I am in the AWOS console I've clicked on the link going to deploy this into northern Virginia.

56
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,480
My application name is going to be school keep my environment in school keep environment one I'm going

57
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,490
to leave the domain blank so that it's automatically generated and we're going to use a preconfigured

58
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:07,070
platform of Java and we're going to use a sample application.

59
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,890
And what we need to do now is go ahead and hit create application.

60
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,520
Now this can take a little bit of time and I mean probably up to 10 or 15 minutes.

61
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,660
So just be patient.

62
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,260
I'm just going to pause the video while I wait for this location to deploy because that took about five

63
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,590
minutes or so but it has now deployed and it is healthy.

64
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,950
So what we can do is we click up here and that is going to go and open the x ray open up our little

65
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:38,040
web site and we can now start generating some sample traffic see this as many times as you want.

66
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,370
Then click on this link over the AWOS X-Rite console that will now open up our X-ray console and we

67
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:50,310
should hopefully see a couple so we can just see one thing at the moment which is our environment.

68
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,730
The reason is we have created an I am roll with that.

69
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,590
When we were using elastic beanstalk.

70
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:04,240
But the I am roll doesn't have the ability right now to S-3 talk to Dynamo D-B or to use the x ray service.

71
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,450
So in order for this to have more circles.

72
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,750
Oh to see more services what we need to do is just quickly go over to services go down to identity access

73
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:19,520
management and we just need to go to our roles and we'll be able to see our role in his search.

74
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,040
The AWOS elastic been still easy to grow.

75
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,690
Just go ahead and click on that.

76
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:31,510
I'm going to add some more policies so we want three more policies we're going to say X-ray X-ray full

77
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,370
access.

78
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,740
Click on that one.

79
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,130
And then we're going to also look for S-3.

80
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:44,040
So you want as three full access and then we also want Duyne D B and then full access.

81
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:51,100
So click on all three then go ahead and hit attach policy and that will now attach the S3 dynamo d b

82
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,220
and x ray full access.

83
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,540
If we go back over to x ray.

84
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,880
So let's go over to services.

85
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,600
X-ray is under development tools or find developer tools and go ahead and click on it.

86
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,210
Now if we click on our service map again let's go ahead and generate some more data by going back to

87
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,940
that little web page just clicking on a few times and let's see computing my map.

88
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,540
There we go we can now see that it's talking to S3.

89
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,040
Now this is just a static web site.

90
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,380
This is just a Web site on our easy to instance that's talking to us three.

91
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,030
Why don't we go ahead and upload some code to beanstalk.

92
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,120
And then what we'll do is we'll be able to play tic tac toe.

93
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,360
And every time we do that it's going to store information inside dynamo debate.

94
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:43,690
And it's also going to send us notifications 3 s and s so the code is in the resources section of the

95
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,220
course.

96
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,360
Once you've downloaded that code just go to upload and deploy.

97
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,960
So here's my file in here.

98
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,880
Eby Java scorekeeper can go ahead and click on deploy.

99
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,140
So that will now upload and deploy my code to the elastic beanstalk environment.

100
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,640
Now this is going to take a fair bit of time.

101
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,590
I'm talking probably 15 to 20 minutes depending on your environment.

102
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,370
So go ahead.

103
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,570
Pause a video.

104
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,040
Sorry I'm going to pause the video but go ahead make yourself a coffee.

105
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,450
Have a break.

106
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,850
And then in 15 minutes time this environment should hopefully be deployed.

107
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,670
OK so lastic big story has now finished and have a look at my logs.

108
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,640
We started it at about 12:12.

109
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:31,020
So it took all the way up to 12:23 So it took just about 10 minutes in order to do it.

110
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,190
If we click in here we'll be able to get our new you borrow and what we'll be able to do is go ahead

111
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:36,950
and create a.

112
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,480
Games are going to use user name as well.

113
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:39,990
All right.

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,060
Hello cloggers.

115
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,490
Hello.

116
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,380
Cloud girs out session is games.

117
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,400
I'm going to go ahead and hit create and that will now create our session and our game name will be

118
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,490
cloud Guerrier and the rules tic tac toe.

119
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,040
So go ahead and create.

120
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,200
So that has now created my game going to go ahead and hit play.

121
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,250
And here we go with tic tac toe.

122
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,260
So I'm going to start off here.

123
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,550
Now let's assume someone puts on there I'm going to go here.

124
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,990
They get to go there and I'm going to go here no matter what happens.

125
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,530
I'm going to win because they can't block it twice.

126
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,080
There we go.

127
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,070
I have now won.

128
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,460
Let's go ahead and click on this link here.

129
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,390
You Trace's for this game.

130
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,430
So here these are all our traces and traces are just events that have happened.

131
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,480
And if you want to visualize it you click on service map and it's now computing the map.

132
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:35,430
This map will have a lot more sort of circles to it because we have allowed I am We've added that I

133
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:40,120
am policy allowing full access to x ray S-3 Dunham IDB et cetera et cetera.

134
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,240
So we can see in here we've got our different know different tables so this school keep a user school

135
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,290
keep game.

136
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,390
We've got screwed Keep move.

137
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,440
I've got school cape and schools Cape session.

138
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,540
So it has definitely worked.

139
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:59,440
Now I'm just refreshed the map and you can see here that there has been an error as soon as has not

140
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
worked.

141
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,480
So there is an S and S component may take a little bit of time to see this.

142
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:10,540
So just refresh if you can't yet see as soon as we click in here we can see that we've had a 1 had a

143
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,800
100 percent error rate and the way we did but that is by going back and viewing our traces.

144
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,210
That's what we saw a little bit earlier.

145
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,620
And here we've got our trace list.

146
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,310
So let's go ahead and click on that.

147
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,730
So go to our timeline here.

148
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:30,210
We can see that scorekeepers had an error and we had 147 milliseconds it was riding to Dynamo d Bay

149
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,080
first it was riding to school Cape game and then to get high school K-8 game.

150
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,130
And then when it tried to do an Asinus publish something to asinus.

151
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,080
It didn't work.

152
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:45,600
And if you click in here you'll be able to see the actual error and it says use r n et cetera et cetera

153
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:51,460
is not authorized to perform as soon as publish on results USS And so we're actually having an issue

154
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,420
with our essence.

155
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:57,130
Q So the way we could troubleshoot this is it's actually in the configuration.

156
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:03,890
So if we go back over to elastic stalk some back in elastic bands I'm going to go over to configuration

157
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:09,260
and then I'm going to go over to my software go ahead and modify and it's this IMAO here.

158
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,240
This email address is incorrect.

159
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,730
So what we need to do is just go in here and change it to your email address and then go ahead and hit

160
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,300
apply.

161
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,860
So I want you to do that now a.

162
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,860
That is now updating my elastic beanstalk environment.

163
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,090
I'm just going to post the video and wait for this to finish.

164
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,770
OK that has now finished updating so we can go ahead and test it.

165
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,630
Click here.

166
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,650
I haven't actually subscribed to this topic because I'm actually just curious.

167
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,360
I haven't I haven't accepted the subscription to the Asinus topic because I'm actually curious as to

168
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,250
whether or not x ray will detect that.

169
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,250
So we go ahead and click in here and I'm going to go ahead and just create a game and then that game

170
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:52,280
I'm going to use the rules tic tac toe hit create then I'm going to go ahead and play it and we'll just

171
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,360
quickly play a game of tic tac toe just clicking randomly.

172
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,930
There we go.

173
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,580
And so that has now finished.

174
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,190
Let's go ahead and view the service map.

175
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,860
So the service map is now loading it can take a little bit of time.

176
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,270
If we just hit refresh it can also take a while for the entire map to update.

177
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,350
I still can't see an s so I'm going to hit refresh again and you might have to do this for a couple

178
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,300
of minutes.

179
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,770
So much just pulls the video on it.

180
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,300
And there we go and see S and S.

181
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:29,350
Now it's down here and it has gone off as Graines so I didn't need to even subscribe to that S and S

182
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,870
topic but it has triggered the s and s function.

183
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,000
So that is x ray in a nutshell Let's go over to my exam tips actually before we do that I'll just show

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,130
you how to terminate this environment.

185
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:45,800
So you just want to go back over to services and we want to go to a plastic bins which is under compute.

186
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,740
Go ahead and click on that and then here is your environment here.

187
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,400
In order to terminate your environment just go to actions and go to delete application.

188
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,070
Go ahead and delete that interestingly.

189
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:02,170
This went delete that identity access management role and it went to leaked the S3 bucket.

190
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,260
You will need to delete those yourselves.

191
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:10,160
But it will delete the easy to instance and the dynamo DB tables.

192
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,140
So what my exam tips around x ray.

193
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,250
So what of my exam tips will understand what x ray is.

194
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:21,180
Understand that it's a way of visualizing your soulless applications.

195
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,160
I understand what the x ray SDK provides.

196
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:29,070
So it comes to three things It comes with the interceptors to add to your code to tracing coming HTP

197
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:35,930
request comes with the client handlers instrument AWOS STK clients that your application uses to call

198
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,400
other AWOS services.

199
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:45,030
And it also comes with a HTP client to instrument calls to other internal and external TDP Web services.

200
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:51,230
Understand what it integrates with so integrates with elastic load balance Alamdar API gateway E.S.

201
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,230
to an elastic beanstalk.

202
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,820
And then finally just remember what language is supported.

203
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:02,250
It's basically all the languages that lambda supports are Java go O.J.'s Python Ruby and dot net.

204
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,790
So that is it for this lecture guys.

205
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,620
The next lecture we've got our very last theory lecture in the coals and then we're going to summarize

206
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,260
everything and then we are done with the civil section of the curve.

207
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,190
So if you got the time please join me in the next lecture.

208
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,690
Thank you.
