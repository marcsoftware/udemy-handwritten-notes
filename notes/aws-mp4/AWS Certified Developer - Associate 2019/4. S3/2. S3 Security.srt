Help overclockers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is all about S-3 security.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,420
So it's going to be a really really quick lecture.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,120
We're just going to cover off some of the main access control mechanisms that you get with S-3.

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:21,730
So the different ways that we can allow access to you as three buckets.

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,870
And then after this lecture we're going to go straight into a lab.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,170
So we're going to show you how to actually configure some of these access control mechanisms that we've

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:38,060
been talking about now by default all newly created pockets within S-3 are private and this means that

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,740
only the owner of the bucket gets access to the packet and its contents.

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:51,500
So only the owner can upload new files read files delete files etc. and there is no public access by

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,670
default.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,580
But we might want to allow other accounts to access our objects within as three buckets.

12
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:05,400
We might want to make our bucket publicly accessible for example or we might have a certain user or

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,400
a set of users a group that users for which we want to enable access to put new objects or objects within

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,020
our three packet.

15
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:20,760
And the way that we can do that is using bucket policies and bucket policies are applied at a package

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,620
level.

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:28,410
So this means that the permissions granted by that policy apply to all of the objects within the bucket.

18
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:35,420
You can't attach a bucket policy to an individual object but the bucket policies are really good for

19
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:41,800
those situations where you have a group of files and they all need to be accessed by the same people.

20
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,150
Now bucket policies are written in J-Zone which is the javascript object notation language.

21
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,590
So it's based on Javascript but it's pretty human readable.

22
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:58,760
It consists of a list of key value pairs and they actually provide a policy generates too.

23
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,220
So that means that they make it really easy for you.

24
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,890
You don't have to start writing javascript.

25
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,930
You can use this policy generator to actually build out the policies that you need.

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,240
And this is something that we're going to take a look at in the next lab.

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,760
Moving on to access control lists.

28
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,500
So these are applied at an object level.

29
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:23,300
That means that we can apply different permissions for different objects within a bucket so we can define

30
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:30,840
which accounts or groups are granted access and also the type of access so read y or full control.

31
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,830
So we can go to a different type of access to different objects within the same bucket.

32
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,800
So it really gives you that fine grained access control.

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,730
And this is really good for situations where you do want to have different permissions for different

34
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,800
objects for different users and groups then Access Control List is the one to use.

35
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,560
And if you want to track the different access requests that are being made to your S-3 objects you can

36
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,060
configure access logs and these are Laux which will log all the different requests made to the S3 bucket

37
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:07,390
every time a user makes a request to upload a file or redefine orderly to file all of those activities

38
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,480
will get logged into the access log.

39
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,600
And this low can actually be written into another S3 packet.

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,940
So that covers all of the main mechanisms for access control within S3.

41
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,140
And don't worry if it doesn't make too much sense right now the best way to learn it really is to start

42
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,420
configuring some of this in the console.

43
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,520
And that's exactly what we're going to do next.

44
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,980
So if you have time please join us in the next lecture and we're going to be logging into the AWOS console

45
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,450
and actually configuring some of this access control.
