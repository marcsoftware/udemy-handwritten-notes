00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,240
Hello Congress and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,500
So this lecture is going to be all about S-3.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,930
It's s 3 1 0 1 and we're going to go through all the fundamentals of S-3.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,250
And it's one of the very first services that AWOS launched.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,390
So it can be a massive topic for the exam and it's really important that you understand how ESRI works

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,350
and that you understand the S-3 terminology.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,270
So let's get started.

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:38,850
So what is S-3 so S-3 stands for simple storage service and it provides developers and I.T. teams with

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,080
secure durable highly scalable objects storage.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,890
So the key here is that it's object's storage.

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,650
It's really for files images the pages it's not.

12
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:59,760
So operating systems and not for databases it's really easy to use with a simple webservices interface

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,510
and it allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,900
So S3 is a safe place to store your files.

15
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,280
It's object by storage only.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,850
It's not.

17
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,810
BLOCK storage.

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,400
And the data is spread across multiple devices and multiple facilities.

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,180
So that means that there is an element of high availability or disaster recovery already built into

20
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,860
the AWOS service.

21
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,800
And what that means is that Amazon could lose one of their devices or one of their facilities and the

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,760
S3 service will still be available.

23
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:41,670
So a faulty device or a faulty datacenter or a faulty availability so it should not take down the S3

24
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,900
service so you should still be able to access your files in the event of a minor fall.

25
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,270
So let's have a look at some of the basics.

26
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,980
So S-3 is object based and that means it allows you to upload object files into the cloud.

27
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:04,860
The files can be from 0 0 bytes to 5 terabytes in size and there is unlimited storage.

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,060
So this means that you don't have to worry about allocating space or predicting how many terabytes of

29
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,130
space you're going to need in S3.

30
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,980
You could just go ahead and upload the files that you need to they will take care of the capacity management

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,250
and capacity planning on your behalf.

32
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,580
So you can just go ahead and upload the files that you need to.

33
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:32,000
So within as three files is stored in buckets and bucket is similar to a folder it's the name that I

34
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,210
ws uses for the location where you're storing your files and the night with the bucket is user defined

35
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:45,750
so you can set your own bucket name so just really say it as similar to Fodor and S3 has a universal

36
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,830
namespace.

37
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:53,520
And that means that names or bucket names must be unique globally and it's similar to a DNS or an Internet

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,400
address.

39
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,920
So let's take a look at an example.

40
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:05,610
So this is our example bucket called a cloud Garou and you'll see at the beginning we have HTP s and

41
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,850
then S3 EU West 1.

42
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,470
So that just denotes that it's the S3 service.

43
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,970
It tells us it's in the region EU West one.

44
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:23,120
And then after Amazon AWOS dot com we see Ford slash iCloud Garou and that is the name of our bucket.

45
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,220
So once again as this is an Internet address it must be unique.

46
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,840
You can't have another bucket with the same name even if it's in a different region.

47
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,990
It must be unique globally.

48
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:39,790
Finally when you upload a file into S3 you're going to receive an HTP 200 code.

49
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:46,500
If the upload was successful Now this is not a code that you're going to see on your browser on your

50
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,860
web page if you're uploading something using the AWOS console you will not say that HTP code you'll

51
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,650
only see this code if you're uploading using the API or the command line interface but it's just good

52
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,810
to know that that is the code that you see if it's a successful upload.

53
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,520
So let's take a look at the data consistency model for S3.

54
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:15,040
And we have two different approaches to data consistency within S-3.

55
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:22,930
Firstly for Puts of brand new objects when we say Put that means when you initially upload an objects

56
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,560
into S3 for the first time.

57
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:33,580
So for Puts of new objects we have read off to right consistency and this just means that as soon as

58
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:41,400
you add your objects into S-3 as soon as you upload your file the file is available to read.

59
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:47,900
So straight away you can access your file as soon as you've uploaded it into S-3.

60
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,180
However if you want to change a file if you are going to overwrite the file with a new version or if

61
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:01,610
you are going to delete that file it can actually take some time to propagate around S-3.

62
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:09,730
So it's not going to be immediate and this consistency model is cold if unsure consistency.

63
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,120
So just remember that when you add the new object into history you can read it immediately you can read

64
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,240
it straightaway.

65
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,540
But then if you wanted to make a modification or delete that file it can just take a little bit of time

66
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,490
to propagate.

67
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,400
So S3 is a simple key value store.

68
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,840
And what does that mean.

69
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:34,340
Well S3 is object based and objects consist of the following.

70
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:41,640
The key which is simply the name of the object or the file name and the value.

71
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,990
And this is really just the data which is made up of a sequence of bytes.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,870
There's also a version of ID which is important for versioning and S-3 does support version control.

73
00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:00,260
So you can you can keep multiple versions of the same file within S-3 and that allows you to really

74
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,810
just go back into previous versions if you wanted to.

75
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,760
There's also meta data and if you haven't heard that term before.

76
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,120
Better data just really means data about data.

77
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,290
And when you upload a file into S-3 you can add your own message data.

78
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,940
So for example you could add the name of the team that owns that file.

79
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,280
You could add the project that the file is related to.

80
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,210
Or any other data that's meaningful to you.

81
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,970
We also have some resources and this is really pocket specific configuration.

82
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:38,060
So we have things like bucket policies an access control lists and we're going to go through these in

83
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,940
a lot more detail later on in the course but bucket policies and access control lists are really just

84
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,130
ways to control access to the contents of your pocket.

85
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,690
There's also cross origin resource sharing also known as cause.

86
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,370
And again we're going to go through this in more detail.

87
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,810
We're actually going to have a lab on cross origin resource sharing later on.

88
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:07,880
And what this is is really setting up the capability for files that were located in one bucket to access

89
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:15,380
the files within another bucket and transfer acceleration is really just a service which allows you

90
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:23,180
to accelerate file transfer speeds when you're uploading lots of files into S-3.

91
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,200
So let's take a look at some of the basics of S-3.

92
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,200
So it's built for the ninety nine point ninety nine percent availability.

93
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,880
The S3 platform.

94
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,420
So what does that mean.

95
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,030
So availability refers simply to the uptime.

96
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:43,340
So the amount of time the service is actually available and when we say ninety nine point nine nine

97
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,460
percent availability what we really mean is that it's available.

98
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,780
The service is there.

99
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,140
It's accessible.

100
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,390
Ninety nine point ninety nine percent of the time solo it's designed for ninety nine point ninety nine

101
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,850
percent availability.

102
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,230
Amazon actually guarantee ninety nine point nine percent availability.

103
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,530
They also guarantee 11 nines durability S3.

104
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,900
So what does your ability mean.

105
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,600
Well this really corresponds to the amount of data that you can expect to lose over a given year.

106
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,890
So we want that your ability to be as close to 100 percent as possible.

107
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:28,460
So we don't lose all files say for example you add to store 10 million objects within S3 with 11 nines

108
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:34,790
your ability on average you could expect to incur a loss of a single object once every ten thousand

109
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,490
years.

110
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:41,300
So thats what they mean when they say that it's a really safe place to store your data with any environment

111
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,050
the best practice is to always have a backup of your data.

112
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,980
Don't just keep it in one place.

113
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,340
And for us three there's a number of things we can do.

114
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,240
For example we can enable version control.

115
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,320
So that means we keep multiple versions historical versions of the same file.

116
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:03,030
So you could roll back if you lost your file you could roll back to a previous version.

117
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:09,020
You can also put in safeguards to prevent accidental deletions so you can prevent certain uses from

118
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:14,550
deleting your files and you can also replicate your data.

119
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,510
There are different tiers of storage available to cater for different requirements or different types

120
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,420
of data that you might be storing.

121
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,510
There is lifecycle management so that allows you to set rules around moving your data between different

122
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,670
storage tears.

123
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,120
There's also versioning so allowing you to enable version control.

124
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,310
We have encryption.

125
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:41,190
So there's a few different ways that you can actually encrypt your data to protect it from unauthorized

126
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:41,840
access.

127
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:48,130
And this is something we're going to go through in much more detail later on in this section and you

128
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:53,820
can secure access to your data using Access Control lists and bucket policies.

129
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,120
And again that's something we're going to go through in more detail later.

130
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,990
And we've actually got a lab all about that as well.

131
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:08,140
So let's take a look at the different S3 storage tears or storage clauses.

132
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:15,400
So the regular S3 which is suitable for most workloads and that has the ninety nine point ninety nine

133
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:23,260
percent availability 11:09 durability and it stores the data redundantly across multiple devices and

134
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:31,550
in multiple facilities and it's also designed to sustain the loss of two facilities concurrently.

135
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:39,850
So this means the S3 can sustain for example a hardware failure a device failure but not just in one

136
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:46,810
location it can actually sustain that kind of failure across multiple facilities and it can actually

137
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,860
sustain the loss of two data centers or two facilities.

138
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,780
So it's really really high availability and it means that you don't need to worry about building in

139
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,050
high availability for your data.

140
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,900
So there's also S3 I which stands for infrequently accessed.

141
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:09,690
And this is for data that is accessed less frequently but still requires rapid access when needed.

142
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,960
So it's data that you don't need to access on a daily basis.

143
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:20,170
Maybe could be for data that you only need to access once a year or once a quarter you pay a lot of

144
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,090
faith in as three but you are charged every time you retrieve that data.

145
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,030
So you want to make sure it really is your infrequently access data.

146
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,770
Otherwise you could start to see some higher charges for it.

147
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:37,660
There's also S-3 one zone I which is the same as I.

148
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,380
However data is stored only in a single availability sign.

149
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:49,920
Now it's still the 11:9 billeting but it's only ninety nine point five percent availability.

150
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:57,180
So that means if they lose one availability zone that means you're going to lose access to your data.

151
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:02,560
So when the availability zone comes back online you should get access to the data but you would have

152
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:09,040
lost access for the time that that availability zone was off line and the cost is 20 percent less than

153
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,970
the regular S-3 I.

154
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:16,360
But just be aware that you don't have that same level of availability.

155
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:23,130
There's also reduced redundancy storage and this is designed to provide a lower level of durability

156
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:29,050
so you only have ninety nine point nine nine percent and ninety nine point nine nine percent availability

157
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,680
of objects over a given year.

158
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,830
So this is really used for data that could be easily recreated if you lost it.

159
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:44,760
It's not for your mission critical data it's not for data that's going to cause a problem and you can't

160
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,760
recreate it if it got lost.

161
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:53,960
So a good example of the kind of data that is a good candidate for reduced redundancy storage is thumbnails.

162
00:12:53,970 --> 00:13:00,180
So for example imagine you had a load of images and you wanted a place to store thumbnails of those

163
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,170
images.

164
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:06,990
You could store the thumbnails in the reduced redundancy storage and store the original images somewhere

165
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,580
more durable such as the regular S3.

166
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,300
Now it's worth noting that reduce redundancy storage is not actually offered in some regions.

167
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:24,550
And we have also noticed that Amazon and now recommending that you do not use this storage class they're

168
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:31,260
actually recommending that you use the standard S3 offering and they have even adjusted the pricing

169
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:38,520
so that the standard class is now more cost effective than using that would use redundancy storage.

170
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:43,850
So there's a possibility that at some point in the future they might be looking to phase out reduce

171
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,120
redundancy storage as an offering.

172
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,790
But for now we still think it's good for you to be aware of reduce redundancy storage.

173
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,000
It may still come up in the exam.

174
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,690
So it's definitely worth knowing what is and what it's used for.

175
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,430
Finally there's Lycia and glitzier is used for archiving.

176
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:09,730
It's very very cheap in comparison to the other three offerings and it's really optimized for data that

177
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:16,660
is very infrequently accessed because it actually takes between three and five hours to restore your

178
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,290
data from glossier.

179
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,860
So you don't want to put data in there that you think that you're going to be accessing it on a frequent

180
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,640
or regular basis.

181
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:31,510
It's really much more suitable for archives maybe historical files that you're not going to access very

182
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:39,660
frequently so let's take a look at this table and this table really just compares the characteristics

183
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,440
of the different storage classes and the main thing to remember really is the standard S3 has the highest

184
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,760
ability and the highest availability with standard.

185
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,310
I remember it as a retrieval Fav for all objects for the ones I own.

186
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,110
I it's only one availability zones.

187
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,950
That means it's not going to be resilient to the loss of unavailability.

188
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,190
If we lose the azy that means we lose the service.

189
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,920
Violacea there's no real time access.

190
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,480
It takes four to five hours to access your data.

191
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:18,690
And for the reduced redundancy storage that has the lowest Europe in NC and the lowest availability

192
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:26,130
and it's really for files that you can recreate if they ever got lost and there is one additional as

193
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,520
three storage class I want to tell you about.

194
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,610
And it was announced at re-invents 2018.

195
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,320
So at the end of November 2018 and it's called S3 intelligent taring.

196
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:45,120
And this is really most suitable for data which has an unknown or unpredictable access pattern and there

197
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,800
are two different tiers with S-3 intelligent taring.

198
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,370
So they have a frequent access taring and an infrequent access as well.

199
00:15:54,570 --> 00:16:00,750
And it will automatically move your data to the most cost effective tier based on how frequently you

200
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,320
access each object within your bucket.

201
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:09,500
And of course the frequently access to is a little bit more expensive than the infrequently accessed

202
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,110
here.

203
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:17,160
So it works out as more cost effective if you can keep it frequently accessed data or infrequently accessed

204
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,440
storage in the infrequent access tier.

205
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,100
So how does it work.

206
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:29,970
Well if an object is not accessed for 30 consecutive days then it gets moved automatically to the infrequent

207
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,040
access here.

208
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:37,410
But then as soon as an object which is in the infrequent access to is accessed it gets automatically

209
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:44,220
moved to the frequently accessed here and S-3 intelligent tiering has the same level of jury ability

210
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:50,150
and availability as you would expect for the normal S-3 infrequently accessed.

211
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,740
So you've got 11 nines your ability and ninety nine point nine percent availability over a given year.

212
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,930
And it's a really good way to optimize your cost.

213
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,970
There are no fees for accessing your data or for moving the data in between tears.

214
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:11,130
But they do charge you a really small monthly fee for monitoring and automation and it's zero point

215
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,070
zero zero to five dollars per 1000 objects.

216
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,340
So it's a really small monthly fee.

217
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,620
So that is S-3 intelligent tiering.

218
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:25,280
As I said it was announced in November 2018 but it's just really good to be aware of.

219
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:32,010
If you are storing lots of data in S3 and you have unpredictable access patterns then the S3 intelligent

220
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,900
taring is one to consider.

221
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,080
So let's take a look at what actually charge you for in S3.

222
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:45,480
So you get charged for the amount of storage in gigabytes the number of requests you do so a get request

223
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,790
or put to request a copy request etc..

224
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:56,520
And there's also a fee for storage management and this includes things like inventory analytics object

225
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:03,510
tags so you can actually tag your objects according to what project they relate to or what team they

226
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,440
relate to.

227
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,540
And that really just helps with cross charging if you are going to charge that department or that team

228
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,170
or that project for the S3 storage that they were using.

229
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:21,560
There's also data management pricing and this really refers to data transferred out of S-3 because it's

230
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,420
free to transfer your data into S3.

231
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,380
But they do charge you when you transfer data out.

232
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:34,940
So for example if you download a file from a story you will be charged for that you also get charged

233
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:40,070
for transfer acceleration and transfer acceleration is something we're going to be talking about in

234
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,770
a later lecture.

235
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,780
But just remember transfer acceleration is something that's used to accelerate your file transfer speeds.

236
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:54,560
When you upload files into S3 it uses something called Cloud front which we're going to go into in much

237
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,140
more detail in a later lecture but it uses comfort front to optimize those transfers so you get a really

238
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,550
good upload speed.

239
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,430
But it is something that they charge you for.

240
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,110
So let's have a look at the exam tips for S-3.

241
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,340
Remember the S-3 is object based.

242
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:20,100
So it allows you to upload files and object files only not operating systems and not databases.

243
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:24,620
The files can be from 0 bytes to five terabytes.

244
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:31,170
There's unlimited storage so you don't need to allocate storage and you don't need to worry if AWOS

245
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,480
is going to run out of storage.

246
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:41,210
The files are stored in buckets or folders S3 is a universal namespace so that means that the packet

247
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,420
names need to be unique globally.

248
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,990
And here's the example of S-3 packet You're all around.

249
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:54,630
So we see HTP s and then S-3 EU west one site that just lets us know that it's in S-3 and the region

250
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,180
is US 1 and then forward slash.

251
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,060
The end just tells us that that is the packet name.

252
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,510
Remember the 2 data consistency model for S3.

253
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:14,740
So we have read off the right consistency for Puts of new objects and eventual consistency for either

254
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,330
right puts into place.

255
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:24,660
So I remember that overwrites a change to a file or a deletion of a file can take some time to propagate.

256
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,920
Remember the different storage classes.

257
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,100
So we have the regular S-3 for immediately available frequently accessed and durable storage.

258
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:44,390
We have S-3 I which is for infrequently accessed files we have the run zone I which is the same as I.

259
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:52,140
However the data is stored in a single availability zone only then there's reduced redundancy storage.

260
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:58,670
So this is for data that is easy to reproduce such as thumbnails and there's a place here for the archive

261
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:04,810
data where it's acceptable to wait between 3 and 5 hours before accessing your data.

262
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,880
Remember the core fundamentals of unnecessary object.

263
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:16,100
So we have the key which is the name of the file the value which is the data stored in the file version

264
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:23,330
Id met the data which is data about data and that can be user defined tasks.

265
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,110
Then we have said resources which is the packet specific configuration.

266
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:34,800
So things like bucket policies access control lists all this we're going to go into much more detail

267
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,630
later on in the course.

268
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,930
We have the cross origin resource sharing and transfer acceleration and all those things we're going

269
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,630
to go in a much more detail we're going to do labs about all three of those.

270
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:54,310
So don't worry if it doesn't make sense to you right now successful uploads would generate and TTP 200

271
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:59,140
status code and that's only when you use the say ally or the API.

272
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,520
Not when you use the browser and finally make sure you read the S-3 AFAIK.

273
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,930
And we've given the link here but it's really worth reading that because it will really help consolidate

274
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:14,970
your knowledge and it's also a really good one to read just before going into the exam or the day before

275
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,920
the exam.

276
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,760
Just to refresh your memory.

277
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,860
So that's the end of this lecture and our next lecture is on S-3 security.

278
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,840
So if you've got time please join me in the next lecture.

279
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,500
Thank you.
