1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:07,560
Hello cloud gurus and welcome to this lecture and this is going to be a lab and we are going to create

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:15,780
our own CD and or content delivery network and in the west there in their terminology.

3
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,940
This is called a distribution.

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,760
So it's called a cloud front distribution and for the cloud from origin.

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,990
So this is the place where the original copies of your files or your content is located.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:36,870
We're going to use an S3 bucket and you can have multiple origins per distribution.

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,570
You can also have an easy to instance elastic load balance.

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,330
You can even have a physical server on premise in your own data center.

9
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,830
But for the purpose of this lab we're just going to use S3 and to get started you just need to join

10
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,990
me in the AWOS console.

11
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:02,270
So here I am in the AWOS console and the first thing that we need to do is we need to create the origin.

12
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,040
So we're going to do that in S3.

13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:13,200
So we go down to S-3 and click on S3 and then go to create bucket.

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,150
Now we're going to create a pocket in place that's the most furthest away from where we are.

15
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:25,000
So I'm located in London so I'm going to use a bucket in a region that is as far away as I can find

16
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,320
which is going to be somewhere in Australia.

17
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:35,340
So we're going to pick Sydney and we're going to call it my Sydney cloud front origin.

18
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,980
Go ahead and click next and click next.

19
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:44,860
And we're going to configure this as a public bucket so I'm going to uncheck all of the public access

20
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,120
protection just de-select all of these boxes and click next.

21
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,870
And then click Create bucket.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,830
So the next thing we're going to do is add a file into the bucket or go into the bucket upload and we're

23
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,240
going to add an image file.

24
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,380
So we go into my images directory and we're going to select a picture of a fairly large image.

25
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,440
So three point four make.

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,000
So open up the image.

27
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:21,130
And the reason we want an image is so that we can actually see it loading so we can see it loading from

28
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,710
the other side of the world.

29
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,650
So click on next.

30
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,270
I'm going to give public access to this image.

31
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,330
We want to be able to access it over the Internet.

32
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:41,790
So click on public read access to this object click next.

33
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:48,510
Keep all the rest of the defaults the same and hit upload and you can see down here.

34
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,610
It started it's in progress so you can see the percentage progress down here.

35
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:00,460
It's not immediate because we're transferring it over the other side of the world over to Australia.

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,710
So there we are.

37
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:09,520
OK so that successful and we can click on that file come down to the link down here.

38
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,130
And hits on the link to access the file and we can see it just takes ages to load.

39
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:24,300
It's no instant like it would normally be if it was stored in a bucket that was local if I'd selected

40
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,960
London as my region for the S-3 bucket it would be pretty much instantaneous.

41
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,370
So this is where cloud front distributions come in.

42
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,890
So let's go ahead and set up our first cloud from distribution.

43
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:47,240
So if we go back to the services section and scroll down to networking because that's where we find

44
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,580
crowdfund under networking and content delivery.

45
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:59,500
So it's like cloud front unclick create distribution.

46
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,750
So you've got two different options here.

47
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,210
There's two different types of cloud front distribution.

48
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,360
We discussed earlier.

49
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:14,820
You've got the Web distribution which is for HMO CSSA ph in graphics.

50
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:22,990
Basically anything that could be distributed using a pay or a CPS.

51
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:34,110
And then we also have RCMP which is Adobe's Flash media server real time messaging parts protocol and

52
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:40,320
this is ready for streaming media is not for your basic web sites or static content.

53
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:46,170
It's just streaming media so you're not going to use an RTM distribution this time we're going to just

54
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,650
stick with the regular Web distribution.

55
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:56,280
So click on get started and then straightaway you see a whole load of different parameters so there's

56
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,170
loads of different settings for cloud front.

57
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,710
And don't worry because you don't need to memorize all of these for the exam you just really need to

58
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:13,250
know theoretically what is cloud from what is it used for how does it work at a high level and there's

59
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,230
a few options that you need to know about.

60
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,920
But I'm going to tell you about those as we go along.

61
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:27,230
So the first thing we need to do is to tell OUTFRONT what is the name of our origin and if we click

62
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,260
in here you'll get a choice.

63
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:37,520
So you'll see the option here and we can see the S3 packet that we created just a moment ago and if

64
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,770
we had load balances on our account you'd see the elastic load balances down here you'd be able to select

65
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,780
one of those if you wanted to use an AC to instance.

66
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,950
You should see that in here as well.

67
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:54,500
And if you wanted to use an on premise servers or your own web server located in your own data center

68
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,240
you could just add the IP address or the registered domain name of that server.

69
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,780
You could just add that in here under the origin domain name.

70
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,750
So we're just going to select the S3 bucket that we just created.

71
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,020
Origin path.

72
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,980
So this refers to different folders within your origin.

73
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:22,080
For example if you had different photos for images videos and HMO files you could put the folder names

74
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,170
onto this origin Paul but we don't have that.

75
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,880
So we're just going to leave that blank

76
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,520
image in our day.

77
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,800
So this is just a description so we can just keep that at the default

78
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,170
restrict access.

79
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:46,220
So this is an option that you would use if you wanted to restrict access and enforce ALL ACCESS to come

80
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,560
via cloud front.

81
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:53,720
So there would be no direct access directly into the three bucket for all users that want to access

82
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,360
the files.

83
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,440
They need to come through cloud front.

84
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:03,460
So we're going to click on yes for that and then straight away a few additional options appear.

85
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:12,230
So in order to set up your restricts bucket access we also need to have an origin access identity and

86
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:18,230
this open access identity is a special cloud for us.

87
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,160
And this is going to be given permission to access your three buckets.

88
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,270
So as we know by default no one can access the bucket apart from the bucket owner.

89
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:36,430
So in order to allow cloud front to access that bucket we need to set up some identity access management

90
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,140
to enable that.

91
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,980
And that's what they said.

92
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:44,510
So it's creating identity for cloud front to use to access your S-3 buckets.

93
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,470
So make sure you select Create new user identity.

94
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,550
So the next thing we need to do is actually grant the right permissions for this new user.

95
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,490
And if you forget to do this it will not work.

96
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,240
So this is a really important step.

97
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,840
For some reason they leave the default to no in which case you would have to go in yourself and update

98
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,270
the permissions for this user.

99
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,270
So we need to remember to click yes.

100
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:18,550
And then that will set up one of the bucket policy and access control that you need the new user then

101
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,690
moving down to default case behaviors that sings.

102
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,260
We have various different options here around HTP and AC CPS.

103
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:40,490
So you've got the choice to allow both HTP and CPS or you can redirect all HTP to CPS or you can allow

104
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,430
HTP only.

105
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,450
So we're going to go for redirect.

106
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:54,950
So any request that comes in is HTP it's going to get converted to CPS automatically and then they allow

107
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,040
methods.

108
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:01,710
So you've got get head get head options head options put post patch delay.

109
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,210
So the important thing to remember here is with cloud front it's not just about reading files accessing

110
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,970
files downloading files.

111
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:19,420
You can also put and post so you can also upload your files using the cloud front edge location and

112
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:27,010
then AWOS will manage the transfer of those files from the location into your S-3 pocket or into your

113
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,200
origin.

114
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:38,110
Moving down here we have the time to live or TTL and TTL is the minimum amount of time in seconds that

115
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,770
you want your objects to stay in the cloud front cage.

116
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,800
So it's basically how long is the object going to be cased for before it expires and then gets wiped

117
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,040
from the case.

118
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:57,750
And it's expressed in seconds so the maximum is 30 billion seconds which equates to 365 days.

119
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,340
But the Dufault is 86000.

120
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,840
And that equates to 24 hours.

121
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:10,090
Now the thing to be aware of here is that you might have files which get uploaded much more frequently

122
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,590
than 24 hours.

123
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:18,250
So for example if you had files that were getting updated two three four times a day or on an hourly

124
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:24,100
basis that time to live is not going to work for you and you're going to find that your files that are

125
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,870
held in the edge locations become out of date pretty quickly.

126
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,090
So in that case the thing you want to do is change this number here reduce it down.

127
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,890
Think about how frequently your data is changing and you want to set the time to live to a fraction

128
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,650
of the refresh frequency.

129
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:52,650
So maybe one half one third or one quarter or less depending on how important it is for your material

130
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,340
to be up to date.

131
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:05,000
And this option here code restrict viewer access use signs you arouse or signed cookies.

132
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:11,760
So this option allows you to choose whether you want cloud front to require users to access your content

133
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,960
using a signed you Arel or a signed cookie.

134
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:23,530
And the reason that you might want to do that is just imagine that you have a Web site and some of the

135
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,220
content on your Web site is paid for content.

136
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:34,740
So what you can do is restrict the access to that content only to users who have assigned you already.

137
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:42,690
The users cannot share you all because it's individual to them and you only released the signs you are

138
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:43,170
well.

139
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:49,150
So users who have actually paid to view the content and that is actually technology that we use here

140
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,680
at iCloud.

141
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,530
Because we have some content on our site which is took members only and we automatically generate this

142
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:02,840
signed Yeoville to enable them to access the paid for content.

143
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:09,970
So just remember in the exam if you get asked any questions around accessing content that you're selling

144
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:16,720
on a Web site and restricting that only to users who have paid for the content then the way to do that

145
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,200
is to use signed Europhiles or signed Cookie's.

146
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,050
And it's not something that we're going to Kawika here right now it's not part of this lab.

147
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,410
But you just need to really be aware of it and understand what it's used for.

148
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:40,810
Then moving down we also have a web application firewalls or WAF and this provides traffic filtering

149
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:46,960
for well-known attacks like sequel injection or cross-site scripting.

150
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:54,080
So this is going to protect you the application layer unlike confirmer network firewall protects you

151
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,210
at the network layer.

152
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,770
This actually protects you at the application layer and the web application firewall is tightly integrated

153
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,350
with crowdfund.

154
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:09,140
You can also add your own domain name so if you own your own registered domain name and you want to

155
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,640
use that as the elf cloud for distribution you can add that in here.

156
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,690
But we don't have one of those.

157
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,510
It's fine.

158
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:24,020
Once the cloud distribution has been created they will provide you with your own unique domain name.

159
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:30,410
It might not be very user friendly but going can give you an SSL certificates so we selected the option

160
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,320
to redirect all pay to HTP.

161
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,960
And that means we're going to need to use SSL certificates.

162
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,580
So we're just going to keep it so the option to use the default cloud certificate but there is also

163
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:49,550
an option to use your own custom SSL certificate and for that you'd need to store your certificate in

164
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,580
WS certificate manager or so you can store in.

165
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,880
But for the purposes of this lab we're just going to keep it to the DeFeo.

166
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,200
So moving down you also see the different ice GTP versions that are supported.

167
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:11,490
So we just keep it to the Dufault and IPD Sexta is a neighborhood by default.

168
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:19,690
So then just go ahead and create distribution and you get this message just about using cloud fences

169
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,280
of private content.

170
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,520
We can just ignore this.

171
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:29,150
And if you go to distribution's on your left you'll be able to say that your distribution creation is

172
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,400
in progress.

173
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,680
And unfortunately with Klout front it does take a while to get the distribution created.

174
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:43,010
It takes around 15 to 20 minutes and I think the reason for that is because it's provisioning to lots

175
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,180
of different edgy locations all around the world.

176
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:53,420
It's replicating your distribution set up to all of those locations and at the time of recording they've

177
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,450
got around a hundred edge locations located in over 25 countries.

178
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,140
So as you can imagine that's a lot of locations to push the configuration to.

179
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,160
So it's just one of the things in AWOS that just takes a little bit longer.

180
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,930
It's not instant So it's going to be about another 15 minutes.

181
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,260
And I think until we can get started again.

182
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,160
So it's a good time to take a break have a cup of tea.

183
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,480
I'm going to post the video now and hopefully in 15 minutes we should be ready to get started again.

184
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:32,750
So here we are back in the AWOS console and the cloud front distribution is now complete.

185
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,070
So you should see a state of enabled.

186
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,820
So let's go in and take a look at this distribution and this is our distribution.

187
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,480
Id

188
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:51,100
And this view just shows the general parameters that we've chosen for this distribution.

189
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:59,080
We've got our distribution already up here Amazon resource name and the domain name appears down here

190
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:05,260
and this to my name is really important because it's this domain name that we're going to use to access

191
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,640
the cloud fund distribution.

192
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,670
Let's have a look at some of the other tabs on this few.

193
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:17,650
So we have the origin and of course you can have multiple origins here you can create others.

194
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:24,100
So you could add an easy to instance that was hosting a web site you could add an elastic load balance

195
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:31,030
you could add any other S-3 buckets that you were serving content from and you could also add in the

196
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:38,620
details of a server that you have located in your own data center and behaviors.

197
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,760
We've got the path Patersons so many different folders that exist underneath the S3 bucket.

198
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,300
The name of your origin.

199
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:54,320
So again our S-3 bucket and our protocol policy so any requests that come in as HTP they're going to

200
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,810
get redirected as a CPS and error pages.

201
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:08,840
So you can create your own custom error response so it's going to display your custom error page.

202
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:18,770
Whenever there's an error code whenever the origin returns an HTP 400 or 500 status code under restrictions

203
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:24,410
you can actually prevent users in selected countries from accessing your content.

204
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:31,770
So you specify either a whitelist which is the countries that can access your content or a blacklist

205
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:38,490
which is a list of countries that cannot access your content.

206
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,740
So here we are we can either select whitelist or blacklist and we can list out the countries that we

207
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,870
want to what list.

208
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,280
So for example we can add them into here

209
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:57,950
we can add into the list of countries that we want to what list and that we want to make the content

210
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,420
available to all.

211
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,830
Similarly you can set it up as a blacklist and just make a list of all the countries that you want to

212
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:11,730
blacklist and by implication any country that you do not blacklist will get access.

213
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:18,290
Any country that you do not whitelist will not get access but we're not going to set that up right now

214
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:24,700
so let's go ahead and cancel and take a look at invalidations.

215
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:34,050
So invalidations is all about removing your files the case in the cloud front edge locations.

216
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,530
So for example if the file has changed the file has been updated but you've still got the old copy cased

217
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,830
in cloud front.

218
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:49,190
But you don't want to wait the time to live to expire to automatically play the old version out of the

219
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,090
case.

220
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:56,210
If you want to remove the object from the case you need to do an invalidation which invalidates the

221
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:01,790
object on the case and effectively clears that object from the case.

222
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,140
So it's a manual process.

223
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,640
You're going to have to go in and do it.

224
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:14,150
But just remember every time you do it you will be charged a fee.

225
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,980
So let's go back to a file and see if we can access it using cloud front.

226
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:30,910
So let's make things easier just by opening another tab so that we have two console windows and I want

227
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,800
to go back to S-3

228
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,760
and take a look at my file.

229
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,290
So we have all linked down here which is using the S-3 Internet.

230
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,150
You are.

231
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,750
And let's just click on the

232
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:56,140
say all files slowly slowly load but I don't want to be accessing the file in this way.

233
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,520
I want to force the users to access using cloud front only.

234
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:06,380
So I'm going to go back and I'm going to change the permissions on this file.

235
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,490
So we're changing the access control list on the file.

236
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:21,810
We're going to remove public access click on Save and now when we try to access that file it's still

237
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:28,410
there now because it's in the browser case but we're going to reload and we see the access denied message

238
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,650
because we've removed public access.

239
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,700
So how do we access it using cloud fonts.

240
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:46,370
Well we need to go back into our distribution hit the general tab and we to get our domain name so we

241
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,720
copy that to my name.

242
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,220
And we're going to use that as the prefix to our file name.

243
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:12,160
And I'm going to change it to CTP instead of HGT P.S. because if you remember but we selected the option

244
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,750
which will redirect any HTP requests to a shitty POS.

245
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,900
Let's just hit return and see if that works.

246
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:29,770
So the very first time you access a file using cloud front it's not going to be cased in your education

247
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,490
so your request will go to your local education

248
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:42,640
and if the file does not exist there is going to have to pull it down from the S3 bucket.

249
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,870
So that means you see a similar response time to accessing the bucket directly.

250
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:57,510
However subsequent attempts to access this follow from the same education should be much quicker because

251
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:02,580
the file will be cased locally at the edge location.

252
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:09,750
And one way you can try this is by trying to access the file using a different browser or using a different

253
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,610
device like a mobile phone or a tablet.

254
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,630
But let's try it now using a different browser.

255
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,950
So first of all I'm just going to copy that link

256
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:30,950
and then I'm going to launch another browser so I'm going to paste that you know into safari and see

257
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,140
how quickly we can access that file.

258
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,560
Yes.

259
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,360
So it comes up really really quickly.

260
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:39,210
It's case locally in the London location.

261
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,940
So we get access really very quickly.

262
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:50,390
So that is cloud front distribution and the main thing to remember is that it's possible to play your

263
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,460
case by invalidating objects.

264
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,720
So that will clear them from the case if you need to remove them from the case and you can't wait for

265
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,490
the time to live to expire.

266
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,120
But just remember you do get charged for it.

267
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:11,430
And remember that you can post files into edge locations.

268
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,650
It's not just for accessing files.

269
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,800
So you can also upload content

270
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:30,090
and finally to remember to delete all of this once you finish the lap because you do get charged.

271
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:36,300
So let's go back into the console and delete everything.

272
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:44,160
So the first thing that you need to do is click on your distribution click on disable click yes

273
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:56,400
and once again it does take up to 15 minutes because it's deleting that configuration from all the explications.

274
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:02,720
So as soon as the 15 minutes is up as soon as this is complete all you do is select the distribution

275
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,250
and then you'll be able to delete it.

276
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,380
And that's the end of this lab.

277
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,070
If you have any questions please let me know.

278
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,590
Otherwise if you've got time please join me in the next lecture.

279
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,190
Thank you.
