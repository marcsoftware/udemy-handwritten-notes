00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,170
And I Clockers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is just a really quick update.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,120
All about S-3 performance.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:17,340
So let's get started now in July 2018 Amazon announced a massive increase in S-3 performance and on

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,040
their Web site they state that they can support at least three thousand five hundred requests per second.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,270
So that's uploading files and five thousand five hundred gets requests per second.

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:38,420
So retrieving your files and this new increase performance negates the previous guidance to randomize

7
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,040
your object names to achieve Foster performance.

8
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:52,840
And this means that logical and sequential naming patterns can now be used without any performance implication.

9
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:58,160
Now as you probably know the Amazon ecosystem changes on a daily basis.

10
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:05,140
And as you can imagine the certification exams can sometimes become a little outdated.

11
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,490
All out of sync with the latest updates.

12
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:17,000
So just be aware the impact is no longer need to avoid sequential naming of us three objects but you

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,860
may still see questions in the exam related to randomising key names as mentioned in the previous lecture

14
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:32,270
and I'm so going to say the exam eventually but it just can take some weeks or months for the exams

15
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:38,800
to reflect any new updates in the services so that is the end of this lecture.

16
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,470
It's just a really quick one to let you know about that performance update.

17
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,810
If you've got any questions or feedback please let us know.

18
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,630
If not feel free to move onto the next lecture.

19
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,150
Pinky.
