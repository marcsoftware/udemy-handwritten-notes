00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,470
Hello caregivers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is all about cloud front which is Amazon's

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,950
content delivery network and this is a theoretical lecture.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:18,390
It's just to introduce the main concepts so that you have a good understanding before we go ahead and

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,390
build our own cloud front distribution in the next lab.

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,500
So let's get started.

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:33,130
So what is a CD and well a CD and or a content delivery network is a system of distributed servers or

7
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:40,570
a network of distributed servers that deliver web pages on other web content to users based on the geographical

8
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,090
location of the user.

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,000
The origin of the web page and a content delivery server.

10
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,030
So what does that mean.

11
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:53,710
Well it's really a web service which speeds up the distribution of your static and dynamic web content.

12
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,610
So you think HMO javascript's image files.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,330
So any web content.

14
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:04,960
And it's a much more efficient way for geographically distributed users to access your content.

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,560
So imagine you are running a Web site located in the UK and you have a lot of users based all around

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,040
the world.

17
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,340
So you've got users in USA South America Africa India and Australia.

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,610
And when a user purchases to your Web site their request is routed through many different networks to

19
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:31,000
reach your server and the number of network caps and the distance that a request needs to travel has

20
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:37,720
a significant impact on the performance and the responsiveness of your website and the network latency

21
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,330
is going to be different for each different location.

22
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,950
So it's not going to be consistent geographically.

23
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,920
So for those users who are further away they're going to experience worse performance they're going

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,060
to experience greater latency.

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,200
So for example for users based in Australia they might experience worst performance greater latency

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,850
or they might think that the web site seems less responsive and uses based in say India for example.

27
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:08,200
So this is where the use of a content delivery network comes in and we're going to use the same diagram

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,810
that we used for transfer acceleration.

29
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,370
So if you remember transfer acceleration utilizes cloud technology.

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,270
But there is a difference between the two.

31
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,940
And the main thing to remember is that cloud front is focused on content delivery.

32
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:33,550
So I think allowing more efficient leads and downloads whereas transfer acceleration is all about enabling

33
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,450
faster uploads into S3.

34
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:43,000
So once again imagine you are running your website from London and you have your users all geographically

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,710
dispersed all around the world.

36
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:50,800
So instead of each user accessing the files directly between their geographical location and London

37
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:57,730
instead we introduced this concept called Edge locations and an education is simply a collection of

38
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,940
servers which are in a geographically dispersed data centers and these applications are used by cloud

39
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:12,340
front to keep a case of copies of your object so copies of your DML files your your images your content

40
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,340
that you're serving.

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,120
And this means that instead of requesting content from your server located in London users can access

42
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,130
that content from the edge location.

43
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:28,030
So instead of making the request to the London server the user is making the request directly to the

44
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,180
edge location which is much closer geographically than the main server in London.

45
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:39,010
So once the request is made the location puts the request on to the server in London.

46
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,940
So it downloads the files and it Keisha's them locally.

47
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:49,180
So that means that next time they user or if another user comes along and wants to access the same object

48
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,200
they can then access that directly from the edge location.

49
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,800
So this provides a much faster response time.

50
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,910
It means that your requests are only going to that local edge location.

51
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,660
They're not going all the way to London.

52
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:07,450
It dramatically reduces the number of network hops for each of your requests which again improves the

53
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,540
performance time it gives you lower latency and higher transfer rights as well.

54
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,870
So objects at Kiesha and that case for a period of time and after that period of time is up.

55
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,310
It's called A Time to live after that time to live is up.

56
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,770
The object automatically cleared from the case.

57
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,890
Now you can click objects yourself for example if you had a new version of an object and the version

58
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,780
of an image or new version of a file you can actually go in there and clear that case yourself to make

59
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,570
sure that when your users try to access that file they get the latest version.

60
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,280
So you can clear the case yourself but you will be charged for doing that.

61
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,040
So let's take a look at some of the key cloud front terminology.

62
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:52,660
So education and this is the location where content is cased you can case content that you're trying

63
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,340
to access from the Web site or from S3.

64
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,240
But you can also write content into the edge location as well.

65
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,030
So it's a two way thing.

66
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,780
They are separate to an AWOS region or availability zone.

67
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:12,710
And actually there are a lot more locations than there are AWOS regions and availabilities.

68
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,050
Now origin.

69
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:20,720
So this is really just the origin of all the files that the content delivery network is going to distribute.

70
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,640
So it could be an S-3 it it could be an easy to instance running a website.

71
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:33,800
It could be an elastic load balance or it could be route 53 but usually more often than not is an S3

72
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,020
bucket or it's an easy to instance running a Web site distribution.

73
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:45,200
So this is the term given to the name of the content distribution network and that consists of a collection

74
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,240
of edgy locations and there are two types of distribution.

75
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,240
So firstly we have Web distribution so that's used just for Web sites.

76
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:04,730
So I think HTC pay HTP s and we also have ATI MP which is realtime messaging protocol and that is used

77
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,930
for streaming audio video and data over the Internet.

78
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,610
So I just think media streaming.

79
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:17,150
So cut from that can be used to deliver your entire web site including dynamic static streaming and

80
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,210
interactive content using a WSS global network of edge locations.

81
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:29,840
So that means requests for content they are automatically routed to your nearest edge location and content

82
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,870
gets delivered to you with the best possible performance.

83
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,380
So as we talked about it could be used to optimize performance for users.

84
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:43,970
So geographically distributed uses all accessing the same web site in London backed by S3.

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,760
So instead of sending requests to that Web site in London users will access their local edge location

86
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,260
and hopefully the Web site will be there.

87
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,490
And if it isn't then the location will use Amazon's network to grab the files that have been requested

88
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,380
and the next time the user tries to access them they will be caged within the education.

89
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:08,240
So platform is optimized to work with lots of other AWOS services.

90
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,880
So as we've already talked about E.C too.

91
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,460
So you could use easy to to run your own web site if you wanted to.

92
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,720
It's also optimized to work with elastic load balancing and 53.

93
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,650
And it also works seamlessly with any non AWOS origins.

94
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,610
So that means you could just really use your own server within your own data center and cloud front

95
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,390
would still work with that for the tudes cloud front distribution types.

96
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,980
We have the Web distribution used for web sites.

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,630
So that's HTP and HTP.

98
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:43,820
S for a Web distribution the origin or the place where your original files are stored can be either

99
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,100
an S3 packet or an h t t p h t t p s server.

100
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,390
You cannot serve Adobe Flash multimedia content from a Web distribution.

101
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,290
And for that you're going to need an ATI MP distribution.

102
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:04,550
So that allows you to stream media files using the Adobe media server and the Adobe realtime messaging

103
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,230
protocol.

104
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:11,600
So streaming audio video and data over the Internet and we can also use cloud front to accelerate the

105
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:19,820
transfer of files into S3 and that is called S3 transfer acceleration and transfer acceleration enables

106
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:27,740
fast easy and secure transfers of your files over long distances between your end users and an S3 bucket.

107
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,900
So this takes advantage of cloud fronts globally distributed educations.

108
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:39,240
And as the data arrives at an education it is then routed into S-3 over an optimized network.

109
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,520
Paul So its a much faster way for you to upload your files into S3.

110
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,580
So lets just have a look at an example.

111
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:54,530
So in this example we have our S3 packet located here in London and again we've got our users geographically

112
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,480
distributed.

113
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:01,320
And just imagine all these users need to upload a load of files into this three bucket.

114
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:07,190
So instead of uploading directly to the back in London which could take a long time for some of the

115
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:13,340
users who are furthest away they can upload that file into the cloud fund education and then from there

116
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,220
the education will transfer that file into the London bucket.

117
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,530
Using an optimized network so using the fast networks within AWOS.

118
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,860
So let's take a look at some of our exam tips.

119
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,620
Firstly remember the terminology the edge location and this is the location where your content is going

120
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:36,680
to be cased it seperate to an AWOS region or AWOS availability zone.

121
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,010
It's not the same thing.

122
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,850
And in fact we have many more applications than we do regions and availabilities owns the origin.

123
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:49,280
So remember that the location of where we are files the origin of all the files that the CDN is going

124
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:56,030
to be distributing and this might be a necessary bucket and we see two instance a load balance or route

125
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,490
53 distribution.

126
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,920
So this is the name given to the content delivery network and that consists of a collection of different

127
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,410
edge locations and we have two different types of distribution.

128
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:15,170
We have the Web distribution which is used for web sites and ATI MP which is used for media streaming

129
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,060
education.

130
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:22,100
And not just read only IAU can put an object to them and have that transferred into S3 locations are

131
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:28,780
also used by S-3 transfer acceleration to reduce latency for S-3 uploads and objects a case.

132
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,110
So that case for the lifetime of a time to live value.

133
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:38,960
And when that type of value expires then the object is wiped from the case and you can clear cased objects

134
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,100
at any time.

135
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,960
But you will be challenged.

136
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:47,210
So that's the end of the cloud front lecture and next lecture is going to be a lab and we are going

137
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,490
to be setting up our own cloud front content delivery network.

138
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,090
So if you've got time please join me in the next lecture.
