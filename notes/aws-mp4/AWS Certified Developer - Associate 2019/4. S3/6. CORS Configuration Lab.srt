00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,980
Hello cloud gurus and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is going to be a lab.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,810
And in this lab we are going to set up cross origin resource sharing also known as cause.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,790
And this can come up in the exam so it's really important for you to know what it is.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,440
So basically it's just a way of allowing code that is in one S3 pocket to access or reference code that

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,330
is in another S3 bucket.

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,300
So really we were just allowing one resource to access another resource and that's why it's called Cross

7
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,430
origin resource sharing.

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,360
So if you've got time please join me in the W console.

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,270
So here I am in the W W console and we're just gonna go down to S3 which is on the left hand side under

10
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:54,470
storage so we're going to create a new bucket and we're going to call it my index website and click

11
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,150
next and we're going to configure this as a public bucket.

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,640
So I'm going to uncheck all of the public access protection just select all of these boxes and click

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:14,510
next and then click Create bucket and then we go into that bucket and we go to properties and we hit

14
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,400
static website hosting.

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,860
So this allows you to host a static Web site from within S3.

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,780
So we go in and select that and we select use this bucket to host a website.

17
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:34,870
And when we use S3 to host a website they provide you with this website endpoint you are L and it's

18
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,550
this website endpoint that we use to access the website.

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,740
And when we configure cores between 1 S3 website and another the access request is linked to this end

20
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,950
point your url.

21
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:52,540
So it's this end point you are that we can figure the access for between the two S3 Buckets and you'll

22
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,650
see that later on.

23
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:00,370
So next it's going to ask you the name of your index and error or H2 AML documents.

24
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:08,740
So we have to actually explicitly type this in so we are indexed to each demo error.

25
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,910
Dot H T M O and hit save.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,900
So then we go back to that S3 bucket.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,840
So we have a few files that we've prepared which we're going to be using in this lab and we're just

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,140
gonna upload these files into our bucket.

29
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,090
So let's take a look at those.

30
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,310
So we've got indexed to each Timo here.

31
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,150
And don't worry these are all going to be available in the resources section of the course for you to

32
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,080
download.

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,870
So this is just a simple Web page which just says Welcome to the index page and then it just runs this

34
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,960
simple script which loads up the contents of another page.

35
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,220
And this is the page that we're going to be storing in another S3 bucket.

36
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,520
So it's just using this script to get that each Timo from the other S3 bucket.

37
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:56,320
So let's take a look at load page to HMO and again it's just a really very simple piece of HMO code

38
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,740
just displaying the page has successfully loaded telcos.

39
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:06,130
So when you load your indexed HMO what you should see on the screen is you should see the welcome message.

40
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:11,560
And then underneath you should see the message that says this page has successfully loaded cloud gurus.

41
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,340
So we're going to upload these three files into our S3 bucket

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:25,280
so we just go in and select all three of those files and upload.

43
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,770
And we want to make this a public access.

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,200
That's going to be part of a website so next and upload.

45
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,050
So if all our files have loaded successfully we should be able to access them as though they were a

46
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,950
Web site.

47
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:51,130
So let's go to properties and into static web site hosting and we're going to grab this static web hosting

48
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:58,600
U.R.L. and that should take us straight to the index page so you can see that it's loaded the index

49
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:05,380
page and it has also sourced the HMO from load page or HMO because it's displaying the second message

50
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,000
down here as well.

51
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,500
So right now all of these files are located in one single bucket.

52
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,150
But we want to have our load page located in a different bucket so that we can set up the cross origin

53
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,230
resource sharing.

54
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:25,900
So we're going to go back in to our original S3 bucket and we're going to delete that load page because

55
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,030
we don't want to in the

56
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:42,370
and we're going to create a new bucket so this one is going to be my cause test bucket

57
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:52,830
click Next uncheck all of the public access protection and click next and then click Create bucket.

58
00:04:52,980 --> 00:05:00,210
Then we go back into that bucket hit properties select static web site hosting.

59
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:12,910
Use this bucket to host the Web site index dot HMO and error to each to mail and hit save.

60
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:21,260
So then we want to go back into our bucket and upload our load to each terminal file

61
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:30,810
next public read access and upload.

62
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,270
So let's just check that we can access our load page or HD him out using the Web site and point for

63
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,240
a bucket.

64
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:43,880
So in order to do that we go to properties on the bucket starting web hosting and we use this end point.

65
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,040
You are out and we need to specify the name of the file

66
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,780
OK so that's your website you are all for our load page here Bill.

67
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:01,720
So we just want to copy that because we need to update our index to HMO to know where to find load page

68
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,590
or HD Hero.

69
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:09,250
So we go back to our file and replace that load page HMO with the U or L for the correct location.

70
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,330
So hopefully that's clear.

71
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:17,950
We have index dot HMO in one bucket and it's referencing the load page or HMO which is located in another

72
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:25,650
bucket and it's referencing load page via the ATP end point address save.

73
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,310
And then we go back to our original index bucket.

74
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,990
We need to get rid of this old version.

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,220
So we're good and I'm just going to delete fixes quicker the quickest way to get rid of the old version

76
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,960
and upload the new version

77
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:56,170
we need to grant public read access hit next next and upload.

78
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,170
I expect it's only going to show as that first page.

79
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:05,240
So it's only going to show us that index to HMO and we shouldn't be allowed to access the contents of

80
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,320
our second bucket even though that bucket is publicly accessible.

81
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,300
So let's just give this a go now.

82
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,270
So if we go to properties static web hosting and click on your static web hosting and point you are

83
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,660
well.

84
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:23,720
So it only allows us to access indexed or HD him so it doesn't give us actor access to the contents

85
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,900
of the second bucket because we don't have calls set up.

86
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:35,210
And if you're a chrome user like me you can view the browser error messages by just going to view developer

87
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,110
and hit javascript console.

88
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,400
And this is going to show us the error messages associated with this page and straight away we can see

89
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:50,240
that our request has been blocked by the cause policy so no access control allow origin header is present

90
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:56,360
in the requested resource so it's failed to load the resource and the server has responded with a status

91
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,710
of 4 0 3.

92
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:03,140
So that's a really easy way to see the error messages in your browser but if you're not using Chrome

93
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,690
I can show you how it looks in Safari.

94
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:12,870
So here is the same web page loaded into safari and we just go into develop and show javascript console.

95
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,970
And I'm just going to reload my page and there we are.

96
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,820
The error messages have appeared below and you just get a similar error message.

97
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,970
So it's not allowed by Access Control origin request cannot load our page due to access control checks

98
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,460
and it has failed to load our resource.

99
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,650
And if you're using internet explorer then just load up the developer tools and find your javascript

100
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,750
errors and you should see a really similar error in there as well.

101
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:42,800
So it's not letting us access the load page or HMO because we don't have cores set up.

102
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,330
So that is exactly what we're going to go and do now.

103
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:51,710
So in order to configure cause we need to go and find our Web site address for indexed or HD CML because

104
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,580
that is the file which is trying to access our load page.

105
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:03,090
So let's go into properties static web hosting and we need to copy this end point address

106
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:14,620
then we go back into our cores test bucket go to permissions and you'll see the course configuration

107
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,480
button there.

108
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,770
So we select that and they provide it.

109
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,630
This example calls configuration Ed to help us get started.

110
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:27,880
And I've also provided this sample policy as a resource in the course as well so you can just download

111
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,550
it and modify it to add your own origin.

112
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:36,520
So the one thing that you need to add in here is the allowed origin so where it says start.

113
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:42,690
Delete that star and add in your new URL hit save.

114
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,080
If you've got anything wrong in the syntax then it will tell you.

115
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,320
But we've got no errors here.

116
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,070
That's fine.

117
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:53,170
So that should be everything that we need to do to enable the cross origin resource sharing.

118
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,500
So let's go ahead and test it.

119
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,160
There we go.

120
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:58,900
And it's work.

121
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:06,070
So we're using the my index website or S3 Web site you are all so if it isn't working for you it might

122
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:11,380
be because you're using the wrong you or L you're using the address of the file in S3 but you actually

123
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,700
need to use the end point Web site you are L.

124
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,890
So you should see welcome to the index page because this page has successfully loaded cloud gurus.

125
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,160
So hopefully you're seeing you're seeing that message so cross origin resource sharing is a really good

126
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,020
way to organize your Web site.

127
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:33,130
So for example you could store image files in one bucket JavaScript in another bucket plain HMO in another

128
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:39,610
bucket and then use cross origin resource sharing to allow the resources from one bucket to access the

129
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,740
resources for another bucket by default one bucket or resource cannot access another.

130
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:51,460
And for security reasons if universal access were allowed that would leave your resources open to attack

131
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:58,630
leave you open to information theft and cause is the safe mechanism to allow controlled access between

132
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,900
one resource and another so that's the end of this lab.

133
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,810
I hope you enjoyed it.

134
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,270
And if you got time please join me in the next lecture.
