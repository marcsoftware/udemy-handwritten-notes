00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:07,020
Help bloggers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture is going to be all about S-3 access control

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:13,470
lists and policies and we're going to be creating our very first S-3 bucket and we're going to upload

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:19,410
a couple of files and we are going to have a play around with the access control lists which define

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:27,570
the access control to individual files and also S3 bucket policies which define your access control

5
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,320
and permissions on a bucket wide basis.

6
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,800
So if you've got time please join me in the AWOS console now.

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,810
So here I am in the console and you will find S-3.

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,610
It's funda storage.

9
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:46,380
So go ahead and click on S-3 and the first thing you're going to see is this dashboard.

10
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,490
And this is a dashboard.

11
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:53,100
It's a global dashboard and it's going to show you all the buckets across all regions.

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,620
So it will show you a global view and if you don't have any Esrey bucket's created yet you're not going

13
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,480
to see any.

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,320
But I already have one and it's located in the e you all into region.

15
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,630
So I'm just going to go ahead and create a new bucket when I create a new bucket.

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,070
Of course you're going to see that in this global view as well.

17
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,360
So I'm just going to go ahead and click on Create bucket and the first thing we need to do when we create

18
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,770
a bucket is give it a DNS compliant bucket name.

19
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,920
So this needs to be a globally unique name.

20
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,600
And of course you might find that your first choice of bucket is not available.

21
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:37,380
So I'm going to go ahead and see if I can create one now and I'm going to call it a cloud guru.

22
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:47,360
Dush Fay I are going to create my bucket in the Frankfort region so click on next and hey on the next

23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,410
page it gives you a few different configuration options or properties.

24
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,220
So firstly they have versioning.

25
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,140
Now you can enable versioning on S3 by clicking that checkbox.

26
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:05,320
And this means it's going to keep all of the different versions of an object within the same bucket.

27
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:11,030
So this means that if you accidentally delete an object the previous version will still be there in

28
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,750
the bucket.

29
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,220
I'm not going to enable that now.

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,400
The next one is Server Access logging and this means that you can log all of the access requests into

31
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,440
your pocket.

32
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,280
Say you want to keep a record of all the different access requests happening on your bucket.

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:33,650
You want to do a security audit for example so you can really easily and I and you can also use tax

34
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,040
to track your project costs.

35
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,760
So these can be completely defined by you.

36
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:50,720
So for example I could add a tag of projects name on the name of my project is the Phoenix Project.

37
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,450
And if you're looking for something to read that is actually a really good novel called the Phoenix

38
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,510
Project and it's actually a novel about I-T and it's all about Devil.

39
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,290
So it's about a really dysfunctional company which is having a lot of problems delivering a new project.

40
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,140
And they finally see the light and move to a dev ops approach.

41
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,010
So they start using continuous integration and continuous deployment as well.

42
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,840
And it's actually a really good read.

43
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,200
Believe it or not so moving down the screen we can also enable object level logging and this will actually

44
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,220
record any object level API activity using Cloud trial.

45
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:34,180
They do charge an additional cost for it but it just means that you can log any activity that happens

46
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,870
on the S3 API and it's all going to be looked at using cloud trail.

47
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:45,220
You can also enable default encryption so by checking that box you have a choice between the two different

48
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,180
types of server side encryption which are offered in S3.

49
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,610
So you've got a 256 that's 256 bit encryption.

50
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:01,780
It's server side encryption and it will use AWOS as three manage Kazan's or so Oneidas s s e S3.

51
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,050
And don't worry because we are going to go through encryption in much more detail later on in the course.

52
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:14,370
And you've also got the option of using AWOS K M-S which is again server side encryption.

53
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,070
But this time it uses the K.M. as manage caes instead.

54
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:23,640
And that is known as SAAC KMOX but we're not going to enable encryption.

55
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,470
And then finally the last option is around cloud watch metrics.

56
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,100
So this will allow you to monitor the request in your pocket.

57
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:39,150
Again it is for an additional cost but it will give you some performance metrics specifically for S3.

58
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,520
If you are interested in seeing those metrics and they will all be talked easing flood watch.

59
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:52,050
So we are just going to stick to all of the defaults and hit next and move on to the public access settings.

60
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,210
So this is a fairly new feature of S3 So if you've used S3 before and you haven't seen the public access

61
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,730
settings feature before.

62
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:06,520
So these are additional settings which block public access and they enforce that buckets do not allow

63
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,100
public access to the data and by default it's completely private.

64
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,290
There is no public access a tool to your pocket.

65
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:20,890
And if you want to actually enable public access if you want to enable anonymous access to read or write

66
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,840
objects into your pocket then you will have to check these default boxes.

67
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,150
However to block all of the public access that is really the recommended setting and that is why they

68
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,870
have introduced these additional steps in order to actually enable public access.

69
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,850
And then at the bottom of the permission section there is the option to grant the S3 lock delivery group

70
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,130
right accesses to the bucket and that the one that you would need to enable if you actually want to

71
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,070
enable server access logging and server access logging will actually log all of the access requests

72
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,350
into your bucket.

73
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,490
So none of these are enabled by default.

74
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,670
So just going to keep Toller's that a false hit next.

75
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,610
And then this final screen that they show you it just gives you an overview of all the options that

76
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,630
we have selected.

77
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:13,750
So it just shows you your packet name and then all of the configuration options that we have selected.

78
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,310
So if you're happy with that then just go ahead and click Create bucket.

79
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,880
And hopefully that should successfully create your bucket.

80
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:27,100
So let's go into a bucket and you can actually create folders you can create different folders within

81
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:37,220
your pocket going to create a new folder called images and save and another folder called Notes on his

82
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,260
side.

83
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,120
So let's go into our images folder and upload our first file.

84
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:49,620
So just click on upload add files and I'm going to select an image from my local machine.

85
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,770
Click next and within this permissions section.

86
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,180
This is why you can configure the access control lists.

87
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,990
So remember access control as they are on a per file per object basis.

88
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,390
So of course by default we only have access for the owner of the file which is me but you can actually

89
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:13,800
go in and add other accounts and grant them read and write access to your objects and you can also grant

90
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,540
public read access as well.

91
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,480
But we're not going to do that.

92
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,810
Just going to go ahead and stick with the defaults and hit next and next.

93
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,820
And it's asking us to select which storage class we want to use.

94
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,840
So the default is the standard S3 and that's designed for frequently access data.

95
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,480
There is also these other options so we have the standard.

96
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:40,430
So this is the same jury ability as the standard S3 but it is designed for infrequently access data

97
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,700
and they do charge you every time you access your data.

98
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,160
There's also the one zone I remember that is the same as the standard.

99
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,900
But it is only in one availability zone and so that means the data is not as highly available as your

100
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,950
standard S3 option but it is a much more cost effective option than the standard.

101
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:05,270
It's about 20 percent cheaper and it's really great for data which is infrequently accessed but where

102
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,780
you also do not need high availability.

103
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,560
And then finally the last option is the reduced redundancy.

104
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,890
This is for frequently access data which is non critical actually lost the data because you would be

105
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,500
able to easily recreate it.

106
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,670
And of course it's not recommended anymore.

107
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,650
And in fact if you do select it they give you this message saying it's not recommended the standard

108
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,890
storage clause is more cost effective.

109
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,360
So we're going to stick with the standard clause.

110
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,000
You can also choose your encryption methods so you can protect your data at rest using server side encryption

111
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,940
and you got the two options using the S3 master key or the IWM.

112
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,540
K and S managed masticate as well.

113
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,640
So I'm just going to keep that to the default.

114
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:52,490
You can create meta data which is of course data about data so we can add something like Content-Type

115
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,040
for example and the content type is going to be a jpeg.

116
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,460
So I'm going to click on Save it for that and you can also add tags so you can add Department.

117
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,650
And it's going to be part of the development department.

118
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:11,310
So I'm going to go ahead and click next so my tag and click next.

119
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,360
And click upload so that it's a file uploaded.

120
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,800
If we click on the file we can try and access the file.

121
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,950
And there's actually two different ways of accessing the file.

122
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:27,220
First of all we can open the file and it's just a picture of me looking very happy holding one of our

123
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,710
brand new cloud gear T-shirts that we had delivered a few weeks ago.

124
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,750
We're going to go back to the console and then the second way of accessing this file is actually using

125
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,700
this HTP link.

126
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,870
So if I select this link and open it in a new files a tab we're actually going to get access denied.

127
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:51,050
And the reason we get access denied is because by default all three buckets are created without public

128
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:51,700
access.

129
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:56,480
So they deliberately disable public access by default on all packets.

130
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,490
When you first create them and of course when we try to access the files from the browser.

131
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,420
That's really the same as an anonymous access request.

132
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:10,640
So it's not using any AWOS credentials to actually determine whether we can access the phone or not.

133
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,020
It's actually treated as an anonymous access request because it's just coming through the browser.

134
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,740
So how do we make this file publicly available.

135
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,810
Well I'm going to try adding another file on try and make that publicly available.

136
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,360
And let's see how to do that.

137
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,370
So come back to the console.

138
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:34,290
Go back to our buckets going to upload a notes file this time so files

139
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,070
selects a text file.

140
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:47,020
Click next and I'm going to select grant public read access to this object and this is using the Access

141
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,040
Control list for that object.

142
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,520
So click on next next and upload.

143
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,190
Now you can see here we've actually had an error with trying to upload a public file so I'm going to

144
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,160
click on error.

145
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,420
Click on upload and see if we can get the message.

146
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,940
So it just says that's been forbidden.

147
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:09,070
And the reason this has been pathy Biton is because we are not allowed to upload a publicly accessible

148
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,710
file due to our packet policies.

149
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:18,100
So let's close that down and go back into our buckets go to permissions and it's going to be under this

150
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:24,580
public access settings and I'm going to edit the public access settings and I'm going to de-select all

151
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:31,420
of these protections which block new public I.S. else they block public access granted through public

152
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,080
ISO's and they block new public market policies and block public and cost account access.

153
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,600
If a bucket has bucket policies so I'm going to go ahead and save and they ask you to confirm and then

154
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,470
I'm going to go back to my bucket and try again to upload that file

155
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:04,620
grant public access it next next an upload so that I successfully upload it and we're going to click

156
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,100
on the file we can open it using the open button.

157
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:13,830
And of course when we use that button S3 is using the credentials that you logged into the console with.

158
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,970
So it's using your AWOS credentials to determine whether or not you are allowed access.

159
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,610
And in this case it knows the owner and it knows that I can access that file.

160
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:29,640
And then the second way of accessing is using this CPS link.

161
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,340
And I'm just going to open that up in a new tab and see if we can get access to that file.

162
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,020
Yes.

163
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,460
So we got access to the file.

164
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:43,120
We're not getting the access denied and that is because we updated our public access policy for the

165
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,680
entire three buckets.

166
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,770
And we also selected public access for the file itself which is managed underneath by an access control

167
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,360
list.

168
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:58,570
So let's just go back to our pockets go back to our images file and see if we can access this file using

169
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,860
using the browser.

170
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,630
And we still do have access denied.

171
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:09,410
So the reason we have access denied is even though we've updated our bucket policy to allow public access

172
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:16,190
to be defined on all files we have only configured public access on a file level using the Access Control

173
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,140
List for a text file.

174
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,700
So that means this file is still not publicly accessible.

175
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:28,010
So just remember really the access control list there an individual object level and they give you fine

176
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,650
grained access control to each different object within your buckets.

177
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,510
But let's take a closer look at the bucket policies.

178
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:40,220
So I'm going to come back to my bucket click permissions and bucket policies and we get this policy

179
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,970
at it's where you can go in and create your own policy using Jasen.

180
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:50,840
But they provide you this really good policy generator which allows you to really easily create bucket

181
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,470
policies without writing them from scratch basically.

182
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,920
So the first thing you need to do with this generator is you select the policy type.

183
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,730
So the type is going to be in S3 bucket policy.

184
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,970
The effect is going to be allow the principal.

185
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:10,250
So this is going to be the entity which you are allowing or denying access to.

186
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,210
So what is the entity that this policy is going to be applied to.

187
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,760
So for example this could be an identity access management user.

188
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:22,310
It could be another three buckets or another as three resource.

189
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:26,360
So in this case I'm just going to add another identity access management user.

190
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,830
So I'm going to come back to my management console.

191
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:37,190
I'm going to open that up in another in another tab and I'm going to go to identity access management

192
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,110
go to my users and I've actually already got a bunch of users already created.

193
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,780
So I'm going to select one of my users and I'm going to copy the I R and my user come back to the policy

194
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,530
generator and I'm going to add that user as my principal.

195
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,470
So it's going to be this user that we're applying this bucket policy to make sure that Amazon S3 service

196
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,850
is selected and then moving down we can select an action.

197
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:08,290
So I'm just going to select get it get bucket policy you can just select any action and the Amazon reseller

198
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,190
name down here is going to be the resource that we are employing the missions to.

199
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,050
So it's going to be the name or the Amazon resos name of our bucket.

200
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:25,520
So if we come back to the S3 management console they've helpfully included it up here on the policy

201
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:25,950
editor.

202
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:31,310
So I'm just going to copy that come back to a policy generator and paste that in.

203
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:37,570
So once we've done that we can just click that statement and then if we if we want to add additional

204
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:44,530
statements we can add additional statements if not we can just hit generate policy and that will generate

205
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,690
the Jason code to create that policy for us.

206
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:55,210
So if we now want to apply that policy to our buckets we just copy the Jason code come back to our policy

207
00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:01,090
editor and we can paste it into the policy editor hit save and that will apply the bucket policy on

208
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,970
a bucket wide basis.

209
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,210
So that is the end of this lecture.

210
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,950
So we've created our first S3 bucket.

211
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:14,410
And remember a bucket is a container for all the files or objects that you upload into S3.

212
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:20,290
All files are private by default or bucket's the private by default and we can use Access Control lists

213
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,770
to set the permission on individual files but we use bucket policies to define permissions on a bucket

214
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,910
wide basis.

215
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,490
So that is the end of this lecture.

216
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,910
If you have any questions please let me know.

217
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,560
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

218
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,400
Thank you.
