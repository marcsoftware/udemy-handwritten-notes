1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,030
OK hello cloggers and welcome to this lecture in sexual way going to look at the CLIA it with the command

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,250
line interface.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:14,300
We're going to interact with AWOS using the Selye inside out E.C to instance that we created earlier

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,580
so you're going to need to look into your E.C to instance.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,080
OK so here I am in the AWOS console going to go over to services and I'm going to click on easy to um

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,080
to compute all I want to get is my public IP address because it or remember it's just going to copy

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,750
this into my clipboard then I'm going to open up terminal and connect to DCC to instance.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,230
OK so here I am in my terminal window I'm just going to type in S-sh.

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,980
It's too high for news.

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,930
And then at a paste in my public IP address and then I think it's called My new keypad PM and going

11
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,490
to go ahead and hit enter.

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,290
And that has now led me into my Amazon Linux.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,590
Am I going to elevate my privileges to route by typing sugur SU.

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,300
Then I'm going to go ahead and clear the screen.

15
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,720
So the next thing I want to try and do is use the command line.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,060
So whenever you using the command line you always start with AWOS and then you start with the service

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,770
that you want to use.

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,230
So let's try AWOS S3.

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:10,880
I was gonna say.

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:18,060
LS We want to list everything now is three buckets now straightaway it says unable to locate credentials

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,560
you could configure credentials by running AWOS configure.

22
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:28,620
So if we run AWOS configure it's going to ask us for an Access Key ID and secret access key and an order

23
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,810
to generate these we need to go back to the AWOS console some back in the AWOS console I'm going to

24
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,000
go over to services.

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,480
And then I'm going to go down to security identity and compliance and I'm going to click on identity

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,110
access management inside here.

27
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,660
What I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and create a new user.

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,770
So click on user Wynkyn add user and the user name.

29
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,170
We're going to add let's call it.

30
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:58,790
So develop a one so developer one and we're going to give them programmatic access here.

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:06,390
So this is where we basically generating an Access Key ID and secret access to the ATO vs API CLID and

32
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,570
DKs and other development tools now using if I don't click this button Yeah.

33
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,380
They won't be able to log into the management console which is what I'm currently logged into right

34
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,440
now and I'm going to just leave it a programmatic access.

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,270
I'm going to go ahead and hit next to add my permissions now and here it says set permissions for development.

36
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,390
So you can add a user to a group.

37
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,100
Probably the best thing that we want to do is we want to create a group for our developers so let's

38
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,580
call this out developer group so developers and we need to then give them a policy.

39
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,480
Now in here administrator access is basically God mode.

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,440
So it gives you full access to AWOS services and resources.

41
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,450
Now whether or not you want your developers to have full admin access to the AWOS console it really

42
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,080
depends on your own corporate sort of governance.

43
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,480
The ease of this demo.

44
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,890
I'm going to go ahead and give them full access.

45
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,880
Of course you might not want to do that because they could go in and start doing anything inside the

46
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,600
AWOS console so it's really down to your company policy soon to create a script and that's created my

47
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,320
group called developers and then I'm going to add a user to this group.

48
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,290
So at a user group I can be a little bit tricky if you just scroll down and you'll see it.

49
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,060
Here's his next review.

50
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:28,230
And so we're going to review we've created our use develop a one we give them AWOS access type programmatic

51
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,410
access with an access key and we're going to add them to developers.

52
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,730
Let's go ahead and create our user.

53
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:41,430
So we have now created our user if we go over and click down go out sorry are here we can see the Access

54
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,110
Key ID.

55
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,400
So let's copy this into our clipboard and go back over to terminal.

56
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,540
So I'm back in terminal going to paste it in.

57
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,740
Hit enter you know tobacco and grab my secret access key.

58
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,090
So grab my secret access key and I'm going to paste it in here.

59
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,410
Don't worry I am going to delete this user soon as I've finished recording this video so that you won't

60
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,920
be able to log in and start mining Bitcoin using my credentials.

61
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,650
So I pasted that in here.

62
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,550
Default region.

63
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,450
This is the default region in which this user creates you know resources.

64
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:20,930
So if my default region was EU west one and then I decided to make an S-3 bucket that bucket if I don't

65
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,300
specify a region will exist within EU West one.

66
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,860
And if you just leave this blank I believe it is the default region is northern Virginia.

67
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,420
So what I'm going to do is just leave it blank and hit enter and default output format again I'm just

68
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,020
going to hit enter and leave that as blank.

69
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,240
So what I'm going to do now.

70
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:39,890
Going to.

71
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,440
Let's not clear the screen.

72
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:49,700
Let's try AWOS as three Ls s three Ls and run this command again and you can see now that it hasn't

73
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,860
given us any error messages just saying that there's nothing in our S-3 buckets.

74
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,480
So why don't we go ahead and create it.

75
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,060
So AWOS S-3 going to make a bucket that's going to be called S3.

76
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:06,350
And now we just need to give it a valid bucket names are going to call a cloud for one two three four

77
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,770
and then my initials are ok.

78
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,480
Hopefully that will.

79
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:10,980
There we go.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,660
Make a bucket.

81
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,290
So if I now type in a B S S3 LS you'll be able to see my bucket.

82
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,580
A cloud girder.

83
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,180
One two three four.

84
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,210
Minus.

85
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,710
OK.

86
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,100
So there is the bucket.

87
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:30,470
And what I could even do now if I just do echo Hello cloud girders and then output that to hello.

88
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,200
Ticker tape that will create a little phone call.

89
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,060
Hello texta.

90
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,100
It takes t and inside that file will be hello cloggers.

91
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:45,310
And then what I can do is I can just do this S-3 and then copy and then I want to copy.

92
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,280
Hello.

93
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,280
DOT takes t to us 3 and then it was code.

94
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,580
A cloud.

95
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,950
One two three four and then hyphen are OK.

96
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,860
And that should hopefully not didn't work because you can see I've misspelt a cloud girs was going to

97
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,590
go over and fix that up.

98
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:09,440
So rather than there we go one two three four and there we go it's uploaded to our S3 bucket and we

99
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,670
can actually see it up by typing AWOS S3 and then ls and then Estrace the name of the bucket a cloud

100
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,330
Gouri one two three four.

101
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,570
And.

102
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,360
OK.

103
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,200
And that will basically list everything inside the bucket.

104
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,540
Let's go over and just have a quick look at this text file in the AWOS console some back in the AWOS

105
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,100
console.

106
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,500
I've come out of that I am screen and the one thing to note that when you do generate an Access Key

107
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:43,790
ID and Secret Access Key You only be able to see it once once if we go back in 2 a.m. we go over to

108
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:49,850
our users and if we click on or use the developer one we go over to security credentials we'll see and

109
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:56,420
here that we've got our access key I.D. but we can't see the secret access key anymore and there is

110
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,450
no way to see it again.

111
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,700
So when you do generate it.

112
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,870
Just bear in mind you only ever see it once.

113
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,830
You might want to save it somewhere very very safe in the next lecture will look at why you want to

114
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,080
save that somewhere very very safe.

115
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,080
So one thing I am quickly going to do is going to make is in active.

116
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,390
So that is now inactive.

117
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,920
What I can now do is I can delete it by clicking that little X..

118
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,560
Go ahead and hit delete.

119
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:26,710
And now that this particular user does no longer has access key idea or secret access key you can recreate

120
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,830
it just by clicking in here.

121
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,640
Create and that will generate it again and again you only ever see this once.

122
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:37,610
I quickly just go back over to my terminal window came back in my terminal window if I type in AWOS

123
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,370
S3 and then LS you'll see that we now have an error.

124
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:46,350
And it says Invalid access key ID then that's because I have deleted it.

125
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:53,210
So I now have to go back and run AWOS configure and then that will allow me to enter in an Access Key

126
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,170
ID and secret access.

127
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,120
And then to leave this.

128
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,750
Now let's go back over to S-3 case I'm back in the console.

129
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,380
Just going to click on S3.

130
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,880
So should be able to see it here it is in here.

131
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,500
A Clogher.

132
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,400
One two three four.

133
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:05,960
OK.

134
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,620
Note that the region is U.S. East one.

135
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,280
So is northern Virginia.

136
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,980
And if we click in here we'll be able to see out a little text file.

137
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,600
We haven't made this public so let's just make it public now and click on it.

138
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,140
You see up here it says hello pluggers.

139
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,230
Be a little bit hard to read but there we go.

140
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:28,640
So you just go over to Darkstar AWOS dot Amazon Dot com forward slash sealife Ford slash latest Ford

141
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,600
slash index dot hate mail or just type in Ajdabiya Selye commands into Google.

142
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:39,300
This will come up and then here you can get all your CLIA commands for all the different services and

143
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,790
you'll see there's an awful lot of them.

144
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:46,820
So we were using AWOS then followed by the service S3 and then you can click in here and you can see

145
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,600
all the different ones we used may Mbaye which was Mike bucket.

146
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,160
And we also use the copy command and you can go through and have a look at all the available comments

147
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,620
in here and different examples of how to use them now don't worry you're not expected to understand

148
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:09,000
the command line in any sort of very deep level going into your exam but you should definitely know

149
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,000
some of the basic commands certainly around S-3 especially if you're going to work with us regularly.

150
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,300
So what my exam tips say OK so what my exam tips will let's start with the least privilege you should

151
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:28,050
always give your users the minimum amount of access required so you developers might not need admin

152
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,590
access.

153
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:35,760
They might just need admin access so that S3 or admin access over s over to it's entirely up to you

154
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:42,690
at a Cogar we do give our developers a full administrator access to the AWOS console because we do trust

155
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,290
them.

156
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,550
But it's entirely up to your organization's sort of risk strategy.

157
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,530
The next thing is to always create groups and then assign your users to groups so we created a group

158
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:58,200
called developers and we put our first use in there who might have a separate group for our data scientists

159
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:04,710
we might have a separate group for our human resources people or people who you know using AWOS in other

160
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,360
ways.

161
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,860
So always create groups and then assign your users to groups and you users will automatically inherit

162
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:16,410
the permissions of the groups and the group permissions are assigned using policy documents so bear

163
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,280
that in mind as well.

164
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,980
In terms of your secret access you're only going to see this once.

165
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,740
If you do not say but you can delete the key pair.

166
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,480
So this is the access key ID and secret access.

167
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:35,790
And then regenerate it and you will then need to run AWOS configure again in order to configure the

168
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:42,630
CLIA and do not just use one access case so don't just create one access key ID and sacred access and

169
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:47,880
then share that around with all the VO developers because if someone leaves the company on bad terms

170
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:53,400
then you're going to need to delete the key and create a new one and every developer would then need

171
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,970
to update daks.

172
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:00,720
So instead just create one key pad per developer and something you should also bear in mind is people

173
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,580
have written scripts to scan get hub access ID and secret access.

174
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:11,910
So if you do put it in any of your code and you upload it to get hub assume straight away that that

175
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:19,440
has been compromised so do not save these sacred Access Key ID and do you know your access key ID inside

176
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,970
get highboy inside job code.

177
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,910
And we're going to come on to another lecture where we can see how to not use them at all.

178
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:31,500
And then finally you can use the same lie on your PC so you can actually go and install this on your

179
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:37,920
Mac Linux or Windows PC and then you can actually use S3 to store your files and I personally do this

180
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,390
up in the cloud.

181
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:45,240
It means that when I'm using my Mac or using my laptop or I'm at home using my Windows PC I always have

182
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:51,390
access to my S-3 bucket and all my files inside it in order to find out how to do that just type in

183
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,610
installing AWOS.

184
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,170
And then there's three different installation instructions depending on whether or not you using Macs

185
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,620
Linux or Windows PCs.

186
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,220
So bear that in mind so in the next lecture what we're going to look at is we're going to look at how

187
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:11,440
not to use X secret access and access key IDs and we're actually going to look at how we can use rolls.

188
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,430
We have gone into that little easy to instance and we did terminate that pairs that cape pair is no

189
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,360
longer valid.

190
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,660
I can no longer access the CEO or I can no longer use the Seelye in the next lecture what we're going

191
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,000
to look at is roll so if you got the time please join me in the next lecture.
