1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,630
Okay hello bloggers and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,660
This lecture we're going to be looking at Amazon's relational database service.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,100
And this is a lab.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,100
What we're going to do is we're going to provision a very simple little RDX instance.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,050
And then what we will do is we will go in and provision a web server.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,870
We're going to use a bootstrap script so we're automatically going to install things like Apache EPA

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,130
HP and my sequel using that bootstrap script.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,190
And then what we're going to do is we are going to go in and basically configure a connection string

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,790
connection string is just a username a password and the address to connect to our ideas for instance.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,490
And if all goes well we should be able to connect to our audience instance.

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,760
So this is a lab and you will need to log into the obvious console.

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay so here I am in the adobe us console.

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,690
I'm going to go ahead and click on RDX which is under database and then what we're going to do is we're

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,690
going to go in and create a database.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,330
So this is a new UI and you can go back to the original one if you want.

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,230
I wouldn't recommend that you may as well get used to the new UI in here we can see our different options.

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:12,210
So we've got a raw my sequel Maria D.B. post rescue our Oracle Microsoft sequel server and Amazon obviously

18
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,180
make the default option Aurora because they're trying to push their home product but it is an amazing

19
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,720
product and I don't blame them.

20
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,970
We're going to do my sequel and we can scroll down here in here.

21
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,780
We've got our different templates you can do choose your different versions in here and our different

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,350
template.

23
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,450
So this is for production use which is going to basically put it across multiple Availability Zones

24
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,020
dev test and then free tier.

25
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,690
Now if you do click on free tier notice that you can't have Aurora on free tier it's not available just

26
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,380
yet.

27
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,880
So that could be an exam question.

28
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,380
So free tier we're going to use free tell with my sequel and scroll down in here we've got our database

29
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,270
DB for instance identifier.

30
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,280
So this is the name of our RDX instance inside a W.

31
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,880
And I'm gonna be a bit lazy I'm just going to type in a cloud guru and I'm going to copy that into my

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,910
clipboard and I'm going to use that consistently across the different you know credentials.

33
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,670
So my master username going to say a cloud guru my master password a cloud guru master password a cloud

34
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:21,000
guru he can actually order generate a password if you want as well you can actually use the command

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,690
line using AWOL secrets manager to generate really strong passwords as well that's just something that

36
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:36,180
I use in everyday and then down here we've got our DB instant size so we've got DB T2 micro so I'm gonna

37
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:43,560
do basically the cheapest ones who T2 micro is fine for me scrolling down storage we've got orders scaling

38
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,720
you can enable or disable it I'm just going to start off with 20 gigs of storage where am I going to

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,880
have a really simple database on here down here we've got availability and durability because we are

40
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,730
using free tier this is all grayed out right now if you wanted to click production then this would be

41
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:07,530
options that you could go ahead and select down here we've got additional connectivity configuration

42
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,710
so we've got our different subnet groups in here it's using the default one you can also say whether

43
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:20,100
or not you want this publicly accessible I'm going to say no VPC security groups let's create a new

44
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,760
security group we'll just call this RDX SMG something like that and then we're going to scroll down

45
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:33,630
and we've got our availability zones in here we've got no preference additional configuration just click

46
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,740
in here and give the initial database name a cloud guru.

47
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:43,500
So we are going to change the database name to be a cloud group and scroll all the way down we're just

48
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,640
going to leave everything else as default we've got our maintenance windows in here.

49
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:53,430
You can do it a particular time in which it's going to do upgrades and in here you can see your estimated

50
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:00,060
monthly cost so let's go ahead and hit create database so that is now launching it can take a few minutes

51
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,510
depending on the size of the instance can take up to five to 10 minutes to actually see the instance

52
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,910
if you click on your dashboard sorry if you click on instances you'll be able to see it just click on

53
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:18,960
ideas you can see here that it is creating while we wait for that to create let's go back over to services

54
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:24,810
and we'll go over to E2 and hopefully our little instance has now been deleted yes it has and what we

55
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,010
want to do is we're going to go ahead and launch a new instance I'm going to use the amazon Linux am

56
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:36,030
I gonna use everything as default and then we're going to leave everything here as default the only

57
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,580
thing that we are going to change is if we click on advance details in here we're going to run a bootstrap

58
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:48,330
script and a boot straps scripts simply runs at Route level and it executes commands in a chronological

59
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,070
order so let's have a look at our bootstrap scripts you can download this in the resources section of

60
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:59,190
the course bootstrap scripts always start with the shebang shebang is just the number and then an exclamation

61
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,170
mark and then this is the path to our interpreter.

62
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:08,550
So this is what's going to interpret all the commands that we do after this line so on line two.

63
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,770
We've got some in store Apache.

64
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,130
We're going to install PSP going to install pitch my sequel.

65
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,860
We're going to force it to install.

66
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,810
We're also then going to update the operating system where they're going to make sure Apache switches

67
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,890
on even if our easy to instance restarts we're then going to start the Apache service.

68
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,720
So it becomes a web server as soon as that service has started.

69
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,680
We're then going to create a little HP page which is just displaying hp hp info and then we're going

70
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,060
to output this child via dub dub dub.

71
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:47,290
Team El directory as index stop HP where they're going to go into that directory and then we're going

72
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:54,010
to go and get this little file which is a connect stop BHP file and that connect top HP file will look

73
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,900
just like this.

74
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,560
So it will say yes name a cloud guru password.

75
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,060
A cloud guru hostname.

76
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,910
And we're going to get the hostname when we go back into RDX and then we've got the database name a

77
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,650
cloud guru.

78
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:10,480
And in here this is the actual PSP to connect in to the secret database.

79
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,000
So basically it says connected to my sequel using username and then whatever the user name is password

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,060
whatever the password is and the host that the hostname.

81
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,270
And that's gonna be the ideas end point which we're going to supply later.

82
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:27,670
And so it will either stay connected to it or it will have an error message saying unable to connect

83
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,600
to my secret database check the database name and try again.

84
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,450
So that is all that we're going to do.

85
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:39,370
So let's grab this bootstrap script now if you just download it and open it up in your favorite text

86
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,730
editor we'll go back over to our Web browser just going to paste it in here and then I'm going to go

87
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:51,780
ahead and hit next to add my storage and I'm going to leave everything as default.

88
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,190
I'm gonna go ahead and hit next to add my tags.

89
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:59,370
I'm not gonna add any tags can configure my security group I'm going to do it to my existing one which

90
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,370
is my web DMC currently.

91
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:08,080
This just allows port HDB and each tick UBS over HPV for and HPV 6.

92
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:14,290
Gonna go ahead and hit review and launch and I'm gonna go ahead and launch my web server and I'm gonna

93
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,960
use my existing key pair which is called My new key pair and I'm gonna go ahead and launch that.

94
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:27,130
So that is now launching what I would do is probably just wait for five minutes and before we connect

95
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:33,340
into this you can however while you're waiting just go over to your ideas instance in here and we should

96
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,620
hopefully have our ideas instance ready.

97
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:42,400
So if we click on instances here it is a cloud guru and click in here get a nice little summary of all

98
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,660
my instances.

99
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,450
And here is my database end point.

100
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,550
So this end point is the DNS address.

101
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:55,150
You're never given an IP for address for your ideas instances you're always given a DNS address and

102
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:01,600
Amazon managed the mapping of that IP V4 address to this DNS address here.

103
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,340
And sorry I should be a little bit more specific when I say you're never given a IPTV for I mean a public

104
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,900
IP for address for your end point.

105
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,590
So copy that into your clipboard.

106
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:17,770
Let's go back over to services and go over to easy to you'll know that your bootstraps script has run

107
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,700
and is ready just by visiting the IP address.

108
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:27,640
So if you copy this IP address and open up a new tab and hit enter that will show this page.

109
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,740
So we've got our PSP info page so our web server is definitely up and running and ready to go.

110
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:38,650
All our scripts have finished installing and we're now ready to go in and configure our connection string.

111
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:43,600
So you need to go over to terminal now and we will go in and configure the connection strings so we

112
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,860
can connect to our ideas for instance.

113
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,210
Okay.

114
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:50,800
So here I am in my terminal window I'm just going to type SSA easy to hyphen user at.

115
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:56,980
And then I'm gonna paste in I've actually pasted this in from my web browser so I'm just going to remove

116
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,090
the DDP.

117
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,030
So now I've got the public IP address and then I'm going to do minus.

118
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,600
I think it's called my new key pair.

119
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,460
And go ahead and hit enter going to hit.

120
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,380
Yes.

121
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,450
And there we go.

122
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:13,120
Gonna elevate my privileges to root so pseudo Sue and I'm going to clear the screen and now I'm just

123
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,350
gonna go over to my bar dub dub dub HD here metal directory and I'm going to have a look in here.

124
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,490
We should have two documents we've got our connect up PSP we've got our indexed or PSP now indexed at

125
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:30,790
BHP was just the pitch IP info one that we saw that we created earlier with our little bash command

126
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,570
and then we did a W get to get this connect OP BHP.

127
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:41,680
So what I want to do now is I want to just open up my connect dot BHP to just type in nano connect dot

128
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:48,610
P HP and that will open it up and you can see we've got the user name a cloud guru we've got the password

129
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,610
a cloud guru hostname and then the db name a cloud guru is the only thing we need to do is update this

130
00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:02,460
hostname to our ideas and point I'm just going to delete this out here and then I'm just gonna go back

131
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,040
over to the console and get my ideas standpoint point case I'm back in the console.

132
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:13,860
Just gonna go over to services and go down to two ideas under databases and a click in there and then

133
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:21,540
I'm going to click on my instances a cloud guru and I'm gonna scroll down and grab my instance end point

134
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,160
which is this one here and copy that into my clipboard.

135
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,240
Now let's go back over to our terminal window.

136
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,830
It's back in the terminal window.

137
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,400
I'm going to paste that in here.

138
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,090
So that is now my hostname.

139
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:42,330
What I'm gonna do is control X hit a yes to exit and then we're going to call it connect up p HP.

140
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,710
Now what you want to do is go back over to your web browser.

141
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,930
So I'm back in my web browser.

142
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:52,500
I'm gonna open this up and instead of going to the IP address I'm going to go to forward slash connect

143
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,290
dot P HP.

144
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,300
Now what this will do is it will hang for a little bit and eventually we're going to get an error message.

145
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,540
And the reason we're going to get an error message is there's still one last little thing that we need

146
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,300
to do.

147
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:10,350
When we created our RDX instance we created a security group inside that RDX instance and this is a

148
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,160
separate security group to what our easy two instances in.

149
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,250
So right now we've got two different pieces of the AWOL cloud in two different security groups and of

150
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,370
course they won't be able to talk to each other by default.

151
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:30,180
So he will need to go over to the basically to the security group section and we're going to need to

152
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,770
allow communication from one security group to another just going to wait for this to time out so you

153
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,940
can see the error message.

154
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,890
So I'm just going to pause the video and if you are patient enough to wait here you go.

155
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,090
Says unable to connect to my sequel.

156
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,000
So let's go have a look at how we can fix this.

157
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,330
We just click back over to this tab we can go over to our we can go over to our security groups which

158
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,050
is in here.

159
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,440
So we've got our security group in here.

160
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,210
We click on this security group that will launch us over to a security group sections.

161
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,080
It's going to close this.

162
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
So we've got our security group in here.

163
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:10,290
And what we want to do is we want to go ahead and we want to go to inbound and we want.

164
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,200
I'm just going to remove this filter so we can see all our security groups.

165
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:20,100
So what we want to do is we want to allow an inbound Security Group 4 3 3 0 6.

166
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,560
And we want it to allow this from our web server.

167
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:27,540
So we're going to go and click in here and we're going to go down to my circle which is port three three

168
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,540
or six.

169
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:35,160
Same with Aurora and in here what we can do is if we actually start typing SMG it will start to auto

170
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,700
populate and we want to wait list our web DMZ.

171
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,810
So whichever security group that you're web server is in some mines ending in 0 6 7 and that is it.

172
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,480
I'm gonna go ahead and hit save.

173
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,500
So can now see that rule down here.

174
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,750
If we go back over to this tab and if we hit refresh There we go.

175
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,240
Connected to my circle using username a cloud grew password a cloud guru host a cloud guru and then

176
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:06,180
it's the actual database endpoint so we have now successfully connected to our RDX instance we've connected

177
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,290
our easy to instance to our RDX instance.

178
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
So that is it for this lecture guys.

179
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,740
A common exam topic will be exactly what we just troubleshoot.

180
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,630
Troubleshoot it one way you've got an ac to instance in one security group and an IED incidents and

181
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,390
another security group and something's not connecting.

182
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:29,970
That's because you need to open up Pt. 3 3 0 6 to the security group that the RDX instances in.

183
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,560
You need to open up that to the security group where you're easy two instances in.

184
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,740
So hopefully that makes sense you go into the security group that you have your audience instance in

185
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:44,760
you open up my circle and you just point a you allow this security group that you're easy to instances

186
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,910
then to talk to your yes instance.

187
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:53,010
So that is it for this lecture guys in the next lecture we're going to look at a combination of multi

188
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:58,290
easy as well as read replicas and it's going to be a mixture of theory as well as hands on practical

189
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,040
lab.

190
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,960
So if you've got the time please join me in the next lecture.

191
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,370
Thank you.
