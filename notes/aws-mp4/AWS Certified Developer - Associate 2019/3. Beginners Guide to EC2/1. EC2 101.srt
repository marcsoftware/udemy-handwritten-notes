00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:06,170
OK hello cloggers and welcome to this lecture lecture we're going to look at E.C too.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,600
And this is an introduction so we're calling in to one or one and we're going to introduce what E.S.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,790
to actually is.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,730
So what is it.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,070
Well it's elastic Compute Cloud.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,370
That's what it stands for so it's ECAC and it's abbreviated to e c.

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,600
And it's basically a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:32,730
So it's just virtual machines in the cloud and it reduces the time required to obtain and news servers

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,360
to minutes rather than in the old days when you needed a new survey you had to put in a purchase order

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,940
you had to go and rack and stack and all the cabling and it could take anywhere from 10 days to a month

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,130
to get your servers.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,990
When we came along it was a massive game changer because suddenly you could provision virtual machines

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,350
in the cloud within minutes and it completely changed the industry.

14
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,110
And Amazon basically led that.

15
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,980
So that's what E.C 2 is.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,460
You can also scale your capacity both up and down you know changing your instance types and will go

17
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,640
through that in a lab and you also are able to scale the capacity out so you can add more and more instances

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,100
behind let's say an elastic load balance.

19
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,740
So easy two has changed the economics of cloud computing and it basically allows you to pay for the

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,460
capacity that you actually use rather than previously when you wanted to go out and buy physical servers.

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,980
You would actually go and the provisions you'd look for a server that you'd be able to grow into.

22
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,590
So you would maybe get a server that had a lot more C-p capacity and more capacity than you actually

23
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,930
need it right now.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,550
But of course you are going to buy the server over a five year term.

25
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,880
You had to plan for five years you know in advance and so people would spend a lot of capital upfront

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,150
and they wouldn't necessarily get the good return on investment.

27
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:57,450
So easy two has changed that now so that you can literally just pay for the capacity as you use as you

28
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:04,140
use it and depending on the different billing methods you pay you know by the hour even by the second.

29
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,330
So it has been a complete game changer in cloud economics.

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:15,060
So now that we know what to is and we understand how the economics of cloud computing has changed let's

31
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,560
look at the different pricing options.

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,280
So we'll start with on demand and on demand allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour or even by the

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,190
second with no commitment and depending on whether it's an hourly rate or a per second rate depends

34
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,780
on the two instances.

35
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,920
So it depends if it's Linux or Windows Linux instances.

36
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,540
By the second whereas Windows instances currently by the hour I would expect that to change very very

37
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,410
soon though.

38
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,990
Moving on we've got reserved instances and this is where you make a reservation with Amazon you basically

39
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,920
entering into a contract and these contracts can be one or three years in length.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,740
But because you are entering in a contract and you may be paying a certain amount up front all of it

41
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,420
up front.

42
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,980
It gives you a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance and we'll look at different

43
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,410
use cases for that in a couple of slides.

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,510
We then have spot.

45
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,400
And this basically enables you to bid a price and you can choose whatever price that you want for instance

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,180
capacity.

47
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,310
And then it gives you a huge amount of savings provided you can actually get that price and the spot

48
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,550
price moves around all the time and again we'll have a look at some different use cases for it.

49
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:29,310
Basically think of it like the stock market is where you want to go and purchase a share let's say the

50
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,670
shares at $100 and you're and they want to purchase that when it drops down to $90.

51
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,310
You basically do a bid when that unit price drops to 90.

52
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,190
You then buy that share and then you could force a sale once it goes over 100 or something like that

53
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,350
so it just moves around all the time.

54
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:52,150
And then finally we have dedicated hosts and these physical to serve as that dedicated for your use

55
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,510
and they can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server balance software licenses

56
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,460
so can be really good for things like VM or for Oracle.

57
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:08,430
Maybe some sequel servers depending on the you know different licenses you can actually bring your licenses

58
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,450
over to AWOS and use dedicated hosts.

59
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,280
So let's look at different use cases for the four different pricing models to start with on demand.

60
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,740
And this is basically perfect for users that want the low cost and flexibility of AC too without any

61
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,390
upfront payments or long term commitments.

62
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,950
It's also good for applications with short term or spiky or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted

63
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,130
and applications that are being developed or tested on Amazon to for the first time and basically throughout

64
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,510
the rest of this course we're going to be using on demand instance on demand is great for learning because

65
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,690
you can go in provision an instance go into what it is you want to do.

66
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,130
Maybe it's moving some abs volumes around or something which will come to an a bit.

67
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,570
And then once you're done you can go in and terminate it and you're only paying either by the second

68
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,310
or by the hour depending on the instance.

69
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,190
Moving on to reserved instances this is you know useful for applications.

70
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,610
Steady State or very predictable usage.

71
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,680
So these might be your you know your web web servers for example.

72
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,390
So applications that require a reserved capacity and users can make upfront payments to reduce the total

73
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,400
computing costs even further.

74
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,860
And the way it works essentially is that if you pay for it all up front and you you know do a three

75
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,720
year contract that's when you're going to get your maximum discount whereas if you only pay a little

76
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,960
bit upfront and go for a one year contract you're not going to get as big a discount as if you paid

77
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,850
at all upfront for three years.

78
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:41,420
And the standard reserved instances can be basically be up to 75 percent off the on demand costs so

79
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,950
again that would be if you are paying everything upfront for three years and then you get these things

80
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:53,330
called convertible reserved instances and these basically have the capability to change the attributes

81
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:59,870
of the reserved instances so long as the exchange results in the creation of reserved instances of equal

82
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,840
or greater value.

83
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,410
So you can basically change your reservations and look through the different instance types but essentially

84
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,660
it means you could go from a very intensive instance over to a very memory intensive instance.

85
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,980
You see you're not locked into a particular instance type.

86
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:21,370
And again we're going to cover the instance type is coming up in a few slides and then you'd finally

87
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,440
have shed jeweled reserved instances and these are available to launch within a specific time window

88
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,960
that you reserve and this option allows you to match your capacity reservation to predictable reoccurring

89
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,580
Shatru that only requires a fraction of a day week or a month.

90
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:42,260
So maybe you have a month and so the end of every month every Friday at the end of the month than you

91
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,280
need you know some reserved instances for that.

92
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,320
But after that Friday is over you can scale it back rather than using on demand.

93
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,200
You can now actually use shed or reserved instances as well.

94
00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:01,250
And then we have spot instances or spot instances or applications that have flexible start and end times

95
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,490
and applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices.

96
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:12,620
So a lot of genomics companies you know people who are in the sort of genome field or big pharmaceutical

97
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:20,600
companies or you know chemical companies use this you know spot instances to do huge amounts of computing

98
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,520
and they will do this at like 4:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning and that will save them an awful lot of

99
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,610
money compared to using the same compute capacity you know from a nine to five during the week.

100
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,310
So there's there's heaps of white papers and studies on that.

101
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:40,730
If you go over to Amazon's Web site and have a look when you go into a spot pricing you can read examples

102
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,030
of exactly that.

103
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:49,030
So spot instances great for users with an urgent need for large amounts of additional computing capacity.

104
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,990
Moving on to dedicated hosts to this is useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multitenant

105
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,300
virtualization.

106
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,210
So you might still you know your country might say that.

107
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:05,000
You know if you work in the health field for example you're not allowed to use multitenant virtualization

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,270
because you could be potentially exposing your data to somebody else.

109
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,560
You know they do ring fence that now but a lot of let you know you know what it's like the legislation

110
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,400
never keeps up with technology.

111
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:24,170
It's great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments and it can be purchased

112
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:30,590
on demand so you pay at an hourly rate and it can be purchased as a reservation up to 70 percent off

113
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,010
the on demand price so that is dedicated Herse.

114
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:40,850
So I've looked at all the different pricing models let's move on to the instance type So here are all

115
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,790
the different instance types.

116
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,690
I know what you're thinking how am I going to memorize this.

117
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:53,570
Well you don't actually need to memorize it going into any of the associate exams where it does come

118
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,500
become useful is at the professional level and to be honest actually insists ops administrator associate

119
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,260
you do need to know the different instance types because they will try and trick you and they'll create

120
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,230
instance types that don't exist.

121
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,210
So it's quickly run through the different instance type.

122
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:14,450
So we've got an F1 which is a field programmable gate array and the use case for this is genomic research

123
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,160
of financial analytics real time video processing big data.

124
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:24,860
Moving on we've got i3 which is high speed storage so that's for things like non-sequel databases data

125
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,330
warehousing et cetera.

126
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,640
Get out G-3 is such a graphic intensive.

127
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,260
This is video encoding 3D application streaming et cetera.

128
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:38,300
We've got our hated ones which is high throughput so so be things like you that reduce workloads distributed

129
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,180
file systems such as DFS map our FS et cetera.

130
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:49,160
So anything that you're using you know huge workloads and you need high disk throughput for them got

131
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,780
Tator to take two is what we're going to be using for the rest of this course.

132
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:57,030
So this is the lowest cost general purpose computing that's available.

133
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:03,320
So this will be like web servers and small database get out date which is dense storage so these are

134
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:09,600
things like file servers data warehousing had do with got our files which is memory optimized memory

135
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,000
intensive applications.

136
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,410
The way I remember that is Ram full with.

137
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:20,290
Then got M5 which is general purpose so this is for things like application servers save files which

138
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,930
compute optimized.

139
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,460
So C.P. intensive apps and database servers pay 3s.

140
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,330
These graphics or general purpose GP use.

141
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:35,540
So we use these for things like machine learning or even bitcoin mining if you wanted to do that.

142
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,010
And then we've got our X ones which a memory optimized and these are like huge amounts of neurons so

143
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,330
these are things like SAP HANA Apache SPARC cetera.

144
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,270
Now with the families you know when you're watching this one might become an EF 2.

145
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,650
That just means it's a new generation or i3 might change to I4 Yaniv actually really going to be tested

146
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:55,940
on that.

147
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,370
What's important to remember is the two letters not the numbers going into your exam.

148
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,200
So that leads to the question how are we going to remember all those letters.

149
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,640
I'll tell you how we did it in 2078.

150
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,190
So we have this duck.

151
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,440
It's sort of like a Scrooge McDuck and I call him Dr. mkt gift picks so he's clearly a doctor because

152
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,650
he's got glasses he's Scottish because he's wearing a kilt.

153
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:22,530
So you got the muck and then what he likes to do is walk around and hand out pictures of Scotland so

154
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,210
he's gifting Paix.

155
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,150
So Doctor gift picks.

156
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,810
Now this worked really really well.

157
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,540
Lots of people remembered it.

158
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:35,100
And you know if you type it into google lots of blogs come up about it and then Amazon released a new

159
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,850
instance type to reinvent in 2017.

160
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,310
And that was the high density instance type.

161
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,420
So it's broken up my mnemonic.

162
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:49,290
So we've got another one for 28:18 So I'm a huge fan of fight club it's one of my favorite movies of

163
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,280
all time.

164
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,080
So we've got Edward Norton from Fight Club we've got Doc Dimmick gift pick software.

165
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,760
Right.

166
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,530
And this is how I remembered them now which is fight.

167
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,710
Dr. McPeek so right.

168
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,580
Dr. MC pace that was the best I could come up with.

169
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:08,190
So I want you just to imagine Edward Norton fighting a Scottish duck who likes to hand out pictures

170
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,220
of his homeland.

171
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:15,570
If you remember a fight a doctor picks you'll be able to remember every single instance type and that

172
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,100
can be incredibly useful.

173
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,610
Certainly if you go into the solutions architect professional exam as well as the soap's administrator

174
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:28,620
or associate as well as any of the specialty exams because you know what a valid instance types and

175
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,900
whatnot and Amazon you know in some of the exam questions we'll just make up letters and you're like

176
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,570
well that's not a valid instance type so that answer is clearly wrong.

177
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:43,810
So fight Dr. McK pics so just remember Edward non-fighting a Scottish duck and it should work for you

178
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,260
and hopefully Amazon won't release any more instance types this year.

179
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,180
But who knows if they do all have to come up with another crazy pneumonic.

180
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,950
So we've talked about Acey to you now.

181
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,060
What it is basically a virtual machine in the cloud.

182
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:02,340
We've also explored that there are different instance types so you have ones REM ones VCP new ones for

183
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,740
graphics et cetera.

184
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,720
Last thing you need to know is what is abs.

185
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:12,280
And if you think of two as of virtual server in the cloud ABS is a virtual disk.

186
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,450
That's all it is.

187
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,990
Abs stents far less stick block storage and allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to

188
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:24,420
two instances and once attached you create a false system on top of these volumes and you can run a

189
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:30,390
database so you can install applications or you could store files on that cetera and you just use it

190
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,210
any way that you would use a block device.

191
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:39,630
So as volume's placed in a specific availabilities zones where that automatically replicated to protect

192
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,580
you from the failure of a single component.

193
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,480
So an ABS volume doesn't exist on just one physical disk.

194
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,440
It's actually spread across an availability zone so individual disk actually dies you abs volume will

195
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,490
be fine.

196
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,350
So I want you to think of it as just a disk in the cloud that you attached to your AC to instances.

197
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:04,140
Now the the ABS volume that is attached to your easy to incidents where Windows or Linux is installed

198
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,270
is called the root device volume.

199
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,060
And then you can have other volumes on top of it.

200
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,700
So if you think about Windows.

201
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,750
Windows is typically installed on your C drive but then you can have additional disks.

202
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:20,230
You can have a D drive an E drive an F drive etc. so you can do that in the cloud as well.

203
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,990
So abs volumes come in different types.

204
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,900
The most popular is general purpose SSD.

205
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:32,370
This is sometimes referred to as GP 2 and that basically balances you know its general purpose.

206
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:39,450
It balances both price and performance and you get a ratio of three IOPS per gig with up to 10000 IOPS

207
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,020
and the ability to burst up to 3000 IOPS for extended periods of time for volumes at three thousand

208
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,280
three hundred thirty four gigabytes and above.

209
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:55,890
So if you see an exam question and it's saying that you know you've got less than less than 10000 IOPS

210
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:02,670
you probably want GP to because it gives you the you know performance as well as best price.

211
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,610
We then have provisioned the IOPS and this is again another SSD drive.

212
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:14,020
This is a very high performance applications so things like you know intensive applications relational

213
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:21,040
databases no Sakal databases basically anything way you need extreme performance and you basically would

214
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,360
use this if you need more than 10000 IOPS.

215
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,860
So if you have an exam question and it's talking about you've got a really big no sequel database and

216
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,150
it's going to use a lot of IOPS you probably want to go for provisions.

217
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:41,110
IOPS SSD as opposed to using general purpose and you can provision up to 20000 IOPS per volume.

218
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:41,770
Moving on.

219
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,520
So we've cut it off.

220
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:49,540
SS day SSD drives before we before we had SS desribes we had magnetic storage volumes so these are the

221
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,040
magnetic disks.

222
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,510
So we've got throughput optimized this is known as estée one.

223
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:59,820
This is used for big data data warehouses load processing et cetera.

224
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:05,710
It's important to realize that throughput optimize hard disk drives cannot be a boot volume so they

225
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,960
have to be additional volume so that example that I use befool the root device volume to boot volume.

226
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:16,200
So if you go to a Windows server it's typically going to be on your C drive.

227
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,380
This throughput optimized disk could not be Yosi drive it could only be your day drive.

228
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,330
In other words it has to be an additional volume comp b a boot volume.

229
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,890
We didn't have cold hard disk drive.

230
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,540
This is known as SE1.

231
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:35,470
This is the lowest cost storage infrequently access workloads so typical use case might be a file server

232
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,020
and it cannot be a boot volume either.

233
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,300
So you can boot from normal magnetic stand.

234
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,270
So this is the lowest cost per gigabyte of all abs volume types that is bootable.

235
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,490
So this is the only magnetic volleyer that is bootable.

236
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,940
This is legacy.

237
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,850
You know it previous generation Amazon don't even include it in their comparison tables anymore.

238
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,840
But you can definitely still use it.

239
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:06,190
And magnetic volumes are basically ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently or what using

240
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,930
applications where the lowest storage cost is important.

241
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,150
So you might want to use your test and dev environments and use it on magnetic while you get it all

242
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:17,040
set up and then move over to SSD.

243
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,020
You know general purpose SSD or provision to IOPS.

244
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,860
So you are at the end of this lecture.

245
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,480
Hopefully you have learnt a lot.

246
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,730
So what of my exam tips.

247
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,110
Well let's start with the four different pricing models.

248
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:33,700
Remember what on demand is it allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour or by the second with no commitment.

249
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,320
You then have reserved capacity.

250
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:41,080
This allows you to get a huge discount on the hourly charge but you have to enter a contract of one

251
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,400
or three years.

252
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,140
The longer the contract and the more you pay upfront the greater the discount so to get your maximum

253
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,080
discount you need a three year contract.

254
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,550
You need to pay for it all up front and then have spot the spot price moves around all the time.

255
00:17:54,550 --> 00:18:02,650
So let's say I bid at $100 and suddenly the spot price goes up you know to let's say the spot price

256
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,730
comes down to 90.

257
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:11,020
OK so previsions my service and then let's say the spot price goes all the way back up to 150.

258
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,180
Those instances would then be terminated.

259
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:18,420
So you're only going to pay for what you bid on and a hundred dollars is just an arbitrary number.

260
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,350
Sure it's charged by the unit by the hour.

261
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,940
Etc. but I'm just using it as an example.

262
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:29,280
Then have dedicated hosts so we've got physical to servers with dedicated hosts.

263
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:35,140
And these are really useful for things like regulatory requirements perhaps you can't go in under the

264
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,710
legislation you can't do multitenant in a virtualization.

265
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:44,170
Or it could be existing software licenses or VM ware or a code or something like that where you're being

266
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:50,920
restricted and you have to use dedicated hosts and just coming back the instance if a spot instance

267
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:51,840
is terminated.

268
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:56,350
So lets say you bid 100 bucks and it goes and you see you know it's provisioned and suddenly it goes

269
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,650
up to 110.

270
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:03,550
So when that happens your instances are going to be terminated but you're not going to be charged for

271
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,780
a partial hour of usage.

272
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,720
So you basically don't need to pay for that hour.

273
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,170
In the hour in which it is terminated.

274
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:17,320
However if you terminate the instances yourselves then you be charged for the complete hour in which

275
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,810
the instance has run so bear that in mind that's a very popular exam question.

276
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,800
And so you go into the exam remembering out you monica so fight.

277
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,510
Dr. Meck pics.

278
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,210
So here we go.

279
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:35,080
Edward Norton fighting our doc likes to hand out pictures of his homeland in Scotland that will allow

280
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,400
you to remember every single instance types and that can be extremely valuable.

281
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:46,540
Certainly if you go on to any professional specialty exams and then also remember our different you

282
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:51,190
know abs volume types that we just cut it off so we had General Purpose SSD.

283
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,140
We have provision to IOPS SSD.

284
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,000
So typically you're looking at anything over 10000 IOPS you want to go to provision to IOPS anything

285
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,450
below you want to use purposelessness day and then and magnetic we have the throughput optimize hard

286
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,060
disk drive.

287
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:09,990
So this is where you've got large amounts of throughput so things like big data with then got our code

288
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,900
hard disk drive.

289
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,480
So this is where we don't have a lot of demand.

290
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,680
And we just want to have the very low cost.

291
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,620
So we would use cold hard disk drive and you know use case for that would be follow servers and then

292
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,210
we have magnetic and magnetic is the only one that we can actually use as a root device volume or a

293
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,390
bootable volume.

294
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:34,290
And this is previous generation so bear that in mind that is it for this electric guys we've learned

295
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,330
an awful lot.

296
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,580
Let's go ahead and get started with AC too.

297
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,380
We're going to go in and get our hands dirty.

298
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,160
We're going to go provision our first easy to instance.

299
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,080
So if you've got the time please join me in the next lecture.

300
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,580
Thank you.
