00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,720
OK hello cloggers and welcome to this lecture this lecture we're going to look at route 53 and it is

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,370
the legacy you will need to log into the AWOS.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,930
But before we do that let's have a brief overview of what route 53 actually is.

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:22,250
So Rick 53 is Amazon's DNS service and allows you to map you don't main names to things like AC to instances

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,260
to load balances which would cover off a bit later.

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,880
And two as three buckets which will also cover off a bit lighter.

7
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,670
So Rick 53 essentially allows you to buy a domain name.

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:37,790
We could buy say hello pluggers dot com and then we'd be able to connect that domain name to three different

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,260
end so either AC to auto load balances or to S3.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,220
So let's go and look into the AWOS console.

11
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:53,160
OK so here I am in the console going to go to services and I'm going to go down to network so down his.

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,070
And here it is on the network and content delivery route 53 or route 53.

13
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,470
How you want to say it.

14
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:06,380
So what we want to do is go ahead and get started now and we're going to go ahead and create a hosted

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:12,410
zine and we don't have any hosted zones what we might want to do first before we create this hosted

16
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,830
zone is to go and register a domain.

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,120
So we go in and register a domain and click on registered domain.

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,310
So now you need to choose a domain name.

19
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,540
Now Dotcom's are about $12 you can get something cheaper.

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,720
Let's have a look at what the cheapest one is or a $9 one.

21
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,550
It's entirely up to what you want to buy.

22
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,580
You can say there's so many different top level domains now.

23
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,330
Here's one for $8 may do UK.

24
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,510
So I'm going to just go ahead and buy a dot com.

25
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,630
You can choose whatever it is you want and then you can just type in here we can do Hellery cloud Gere's

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,070
I'm pretty sure that is taken.

27
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:53,040
Pretty sure I bought it from some but you know in another course maybe it would do.

28
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,590
I'm a cloud.

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,780
Dot com.

30
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,550
Let's see if that's available.

31
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,960
Yes it is available.

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,430
We're going to go ahead and add it to my cart then I'm going to go down and hit continue.

33
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,480
Now we have to fill in all this registrant information.

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,650
So I'm going to go ahead and do that.

35
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,190
You can do this yourself.

36
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,050
And once that's done I'm going to go ahead and hit submit.

37
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,790
OK so I have gone ahead and filled that out.

38
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,350
I just need to agree to the terms and conditions.

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,480
It's going to send me an e-mail to the registrant e-mail address just to check that I actually ynot

40
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,150
and you won't be able to get past the screen until you've verified that e-mail case you've just gone

41
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,840
ahead and verified that e-mail is just refreshed the status here.

42
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,460
And we can say that has been registered.

43
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,240
Now we're going to go ahead and hit complete purchase and that has now purchased my domains.

44
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,970
So it says thank you for registering your domain to route 53.

45
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,070
I'm a coward Gary.

46
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,080
Dot com.

47
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,050
What's next.

48
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,440
Domain registration might take up to three days to complete.

49
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,720
We'll send an e-mail to the registrant contact.

50
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,320
Once the domain is successfully registered so you just click on go to domain's and you say that this

51
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,030
status is domain registration in progress.

52
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,560
Now it doesn't normally take three days.

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,010
It depends what top level domain name that you use.

54
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,330
I'm just going to pause the video and wait for this domain name to become available.

55
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,920
OK so this is now available for disclosure.

56
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,610
It was a long weekend over the you know over the last few days.

57
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,840
So this is a few days later but you should be able to register it.

58
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,200
You know within a few hours it really just penciled the top level domain.

59
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:33,290
So we get it back over to our dashboard and we click on hosted zones you'll be able to see your domain

60
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,000
inheres.

61
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,800
So I'm a cloud Gouri dot com.

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,280
Now what we can do is we can go ahead and go to our record sets.

63
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,890
And this is where we create our DNS records so if we go back over we can create things like our a a

64
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:53,690
record and a record is essentially if you think of an old school telephone book you used to look up

65
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,970
Mr. Smith in the telephone book and you get a phone number.

66
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,370
Essentially when you're creating an error code it's exactly the same thing.

67
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,350
What we're doing is we're saying where I'm a cowgirl.

68
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,680
Dot Com is going to guard.

69
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:12,380
So if we just click on create a record set you'll be able to see the different types of records in here.

70
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,420
So we've got a record See name records of MX records Triple-A records et cetera.

71
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,850
So a record would point to an IP address.

72
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:27,490
A triple-A record of quadruple a record would point to an IP B-6 address et cetera et cetera.

73
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,660
So what we're going to do is we're going to create a address and we're going to use what's called the

74
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,800
naked domain name.

75
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,410
So what do we mean by naked domain name where we simply just mean I'm a cow.

76
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,910
Dot com rather than w w w dot I'm a cloud Gouri dot com.

77
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:47,190
And this is sometimes also referred to as the zone apex record.

78
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,120
Now in order to do this we have to use an alias.

79
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:56,040
I'd be interested what an alias is just hold your mouse over it says specify whether you want this record

80
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:03,730
set to be an alias for an AWOS or resorts an alias it is similar in some ways to a C name record set.

81
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:09,920
Well one of the differences is that you create an alias for the zone apex we create this for the naked

82
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:18,560
domain name and this it basically is only supported by a and quadrupole a record so IPV for IPV six

83
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,840
addresses so what we're going to do is in here we're going to click in here and we've got our different

84
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,230
targets so you can have an alias target for an S-3 Web site for an elastic load balance the application

85
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:36,200
load balance elastic load balance a classic load balance the elastic load balance and network load balance.

86
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,660
The cloud front distributions for lastic beanstalk environments etc..

87
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,020
So what we're going to do is we're going to have to go and create a load balancer.

88
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,270
And then what we're going to do is put out two instance behind that load balance and then we'll come

89
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:57,830
back here and basically create the DNS name so that when people go to out my name they'll be able to

90
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,420
see a little Web site.

91
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,540
So let's go back over two services are going to go over to see too.

92
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,290
We should still have our little E.S. to instance up and running that we created earlier.

93
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,860
I have no idea why but for some reason I'm in Oregon.

94
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:17,990
A little bit confusing so if you do not see for instance just check where you should be should be back

95
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,990
in northern Virginia and yet I can see my instance there.

96
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:27,020
And then what you want to do in order to create a load balance is if you go down to load balancing you

97
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:34,250
see it right here and just create a go to load balances and click on that link and you'll see that right

98
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,250
now we don't have any load balances in this region.

99
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,210
So go ahead and create a load balance.

100
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,520
So there's three different types of load balance as we have application load balances network load balances

101
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,360
and classic load balances.

102
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,430
Now application load balance is when you need to be you know basically using web applications for the

103
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,650
page.

104
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,600
And this operates at the request level network.

105
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,830
Lloyd balancers you would use when you need Oktar high performance and static IP addresses for your

106
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,550
application.

107
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,050
So we're going to go ahead and create an application load balance so in here you might want to give

108
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,140
it a name so I'm going to call up my base application load balance.

109
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,840
It's going to be Internet facing it's going to be using IP before.

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,490
So in here we have our listeners now listeners simply what to port our application load balance is going

111
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,500
to listen on Sohaib GDP is on port 80 and if you wanted to do to the best you can do it as well which

112
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:31,220
will be on port 443 just zoomed out my screen a little bit if you don't want to use SSL you can delete

113
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,470
that.

114
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,090
I'm going to take it off for now so I don't want to listen on SSL.

115
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,040
And here we have our availability zone.

116
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,990
So where do we want our application load balance to be based.

117
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,780
We're going to select all availabilities zones to get the maximum redundancy.

118
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,080
And next I'm going to go ahead and configure my security groups.

119
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,790
So it's going to give us this warning saying that it's not using a secure listener.

120
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,910
In other words we're not using AHCCCS.

121
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,800
That's fine.

122
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,770
Hit next.

123
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,100
And then we're going to assign a security groups let's assign the one that we created in the last election.

124
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:07,930
So I'm going to assign our my web DMZ and I'm going to go ahead and hit next to configure our routing.

125
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,610
So we're basically setting up Route requests to the targets in this target group so you can have a whole

126
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,440
bunch of different targets and you can route requests you know intelligently.

127
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,490
It's entirely up to you.

128
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:25,790
Might have like you know web servers in one routing group you might have application servers and another

129
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,290
you might have my Secord database service and another et cetera.

130
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,910
So going to create a new target group.

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,470
Nicole is my Webbs is great and we're going to do it on port NHT to pay on port 80.

132
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:44,630
The target type is simply whether or not the target's going to be registered using your instance IDs

133
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,810
the actual I.D. of the two incidents or using private IP addresses.

134
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,590
I'm going to use instance IDs as the default value.

135
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,060
And here we have our health check.

136
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,160
So what is it going to look for when it goes and you know does a health check.

137
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,060
So we're going to type in here though little web page that we created index dot.

138
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,990
Tim ELB I'll leave everything else as default and we're going to go in and register our targets.

139
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,010
So I'm going to add this to de-registered.

140
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,810
Great.

141
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:17,720
And then I'm going to go ahead and hit review and I'm going to go ahead and hit create now the health

142
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,400
check will take a little while to bring this load balance in to service is healthy.

143
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,320
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to I'm going to take a while to provision.

144
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,980
So I'm going to pause the video and wait for this elastic load sorry application load balance to come

145
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,220
up online.

146
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:37,340
OK so that should hopefully be set up let's just hit refresh and we can now see the state has changed

147
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,600
to active.

148
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,570
We actually go into the target groups we should be able to see if that what targets are healthy so we

149
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:50,260
can see here we've got a registered target his our instance I.D. and that status is healthy.

150
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,600
So it has found that indexed not hiked yemo.

151
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,190
And so the very last thing we need to do is we need to go over to services.

152
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,630
We're going to go back to route 53 which is under network content and delivery and we're going to click

153
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:08,770
on there and what we're going to do is we're going to point our DNS to our application load balance.

154
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,970
So click in here and we'll go.

155
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,320
Just click on the link and you can see in here this is our host at Xyron So we're going to create a

156
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,820
record set and we're going to do an alias record and in here we'll be able to see the target.

157
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,370
So here it is my baby.

158
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,630
I'm going to click in there and I'm going to leave everything else as default and go ahead and hit create.

159
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,030
And so now what we're going to do is to open up a new tab and we're going to go to I'm a cloud guru

160
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,810
dot com.

161
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,420
OK so here we are I'm just going to open up.

162
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:46,250
Yeah I'm going to type I'm a cloud girl or dot com and if we minimize though we go says hello cloud

163
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,580
girl.

164
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:53,630
So we have now created a working Web site it's behind an application load balancer which is spread across

165
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,050
multiple availability zones.

166
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:00,590
And then when we go to resolve the name I'm a cloud Gouri that's basically sending traffic to our application

167
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,490
load balance which is sending traffic to our e c to instance.

168
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,420
So that is it for this electrolyze hopefully you've learnt a lot.

169
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,540
The next lecture what we're going to do is we're going to look into our easy to instance and we're going

170
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:18,320
to show you how to set up a user so that they can access S-3 using the command line and it's very important

171
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,800
to understand how to do that.

172
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,290
Going into your exam so if you've got the time please join me in the next lecture.

173
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:23,800
Thank you.
