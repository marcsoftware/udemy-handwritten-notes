00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:07,040
OK hello cloggers and welcome to this lecture this lecture is actually for Windows users only.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,960
And we're basically just going to teach you how to use potty and potty Cajun and you need to use potty

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:21,010
in order to S-sh into your easy to instance and you need potty and in order to convert you'll be M-file.

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:27,480
This is the key pedophile that's generated when you first create an instance and a crate is generated

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,860
in a dopy format but poddy doesn't support PE files.

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,370
They poddy needs that time PBK files.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,990
So basically puttee Cajun turns p m files into PPK files.

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,280
So in order to do this you need to open up your browser.

9
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,520
OK so here we are in our browser.

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:50,610
I'm on Google and I'm just going to type in putty and there we go we've got the potty download page

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,680
and that's our top green and all.

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,530
Don't you case.

13
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:00,090
Just click on that and then basically you just want to save the party say and you want to save the putty

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,660
Gen X C to the top and the bottom link.

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,930
Once you've done that it will finish downloading.

16
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,780
You might just want to copy this across to your desktop just because you will be using this a lot throughout

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,850
the course.

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,380
So if I just minimized everything and refresh my desktop There we go we can save putty.

19
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,100
So potty is always the computer to computer icons.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,510
This is what you're going to use when you're exercising and then PATTI-JANE is always the key generator.

21
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,060
So it's got a computer to key icon.

22
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,190
So the next thing we want to do is just go ahead to the AWOS management console we want to launch an

23
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,140
instance.

24
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,590
So we go in and launch an AC to instance and then use the Amazon Linux.

25
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,260
Am I going to delete everything else as default because I just want to show you how to connect into

26
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,410
this instance.

27
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:54,870
I'm just going to call this putty as my instance and then go ahead and hit next.

28
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:01,210
Going to add create a new security group I'm just going to leave it open to the world in moments launch

29
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,650
was at â‚¬1 might look like.

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,140
Launch was to.

31
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,880
But just leave S-sh open to the world.

32
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,860
It is a security risk.

33
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,740
You could lock it down to your IP address.

34
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,420
But again this is just for demo purposes only.

35
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,030
Go ahead and hit launch.

36
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,230
Now we want to create a new case to MICKOLUS My Katie.

37
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:26,160
Katie and we're going to download this KPN now you'll see here it says it's been downloaded as adult.

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,280
P M-file.

39
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,870
And in order for us to be able to use this with Cotty we need to convert it to a PPK file and that's

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,460
where Pati Cajun comes in.

41
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:43,300
So we minimize and go back to our desktop and we open up PATTI-JANE we will be able to do that first.

42
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,250
I'm just going to kick off this instance those two and then go ahead and hit launch.

43
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,610
OK so that is now launching.

44
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,470
So while that's going on again I'm going to go back into Puttock Cajun.

45
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,940
I'm just going to open it up now you might get this message saying protect your PC.

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,590
Just click more info and hit run anyway.

47
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,580
And so here we go with go potty.

48
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,480
So the first thing we need to do is go and load our case.

49
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,070
So go ahead and hit load.

50
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,320
Now this compares a lot of people straight away because they can't say they came.

51
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,600
That's because it's looking for a PPK file but we saved it as a P M-file.

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,530
So what we want to do is just hit all files down here and then open up my party.

53
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:26,520
PM And there we go says successfully imported it to use this case with potti you need to use the saved

54
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,400
private key command to save it and putties arm format.

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,340
So we're going to go ahead and do that.

56
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,410
It's saved private.

57
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,740
K this is asking about a pass phrase if you want to protect it.

58
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,630
What you can do is passphrases just basically a password so you need a password in order to open up

59
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,350
this case just an extra level of protection.

60
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,820
Most people you know for the purposes of this course you don't need to if you're going to do this in

61
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,500
production maybe you do want one it's going to go ahead and hit yes.

62
00:03:53,850 --> 00:04:00,480
And then what we're going to do I'm just going to change this to all files I'm going to change.

63
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,380
Click on here so maintains the same file name but then instead of saving as adult p p p am I'm going

64
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,040
to save it as a dot OK.

65
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,480
Go ahead and hit size.

66
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,270
And that is literally it.

67
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:17,670
Now we go into our downloads directory we can see a p m file and we can see a PPK file.

68
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,200
So the next thing we need to do is open up party.

69
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,080
So it is puttee.

70
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,140
It's a very simple interface to use.

71
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,950
I'm going to go ahead and go and look at my Acey two instances and hopefully it is live now.

72
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,710
And I will be able to get an IP address.

73
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,000
So here it is.

74
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,960
And there's my pin address down here so I'm going to highlight the IP address and I'm going to right

75
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,600
click and copy it.

76
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:49,970
Now if we go back over to our party configuration we can type in here a c too high end user.

77
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:57,600
And then at and then the putty the IP address is $52 51 to 120 to 70.

78
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,080
Now what I can do is also copy and paste this save sessions one of them save it just yet is the last

79
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,880
thing we want to do is go to here's we're going to go into S-sh we're going to go over to walls and

80
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,120
in here we're going to enter with our private key is so this is the one that we've just generated.

81
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,530
My party Kaid PPK going to open it up.

82
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,640
And now we we go all the way back up to the top to session we can hit save We don't need to do this

83
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,660
again.

84
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,810
We can basically just go in it load.

85
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,130
And then open.

86
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,570
So let's go ahead and open that first thing it's going to ask is about service.

87
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,870
Case cashed in the registry.

88
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,960
So you just go ahead and.

89
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,670
Yes.

90
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,250
And there we go with connected into our easy to instance.

91
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,840
Now you can see this is quite small can be quite hard to read.

92
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:49,040
So let's close this off and just close the session then what I'm going to do and I'm just going to go

93
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,550
back to my desktop and I'm going to open up.

94
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,500
Party will load up our default settings.

95
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,290
Now we can actually change the appearance.

96
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,080
We can go in here and change the font size.

97
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:05,500
So you go here and it's 20 that's going to change the font you change the colors etc..

98
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,280
I'm just going to leave the colors as standard and then keep the font as 20 I'm going to go ahead and

99
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,330
save that.

100
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,800
Now when we open it's going to be much bigger.

101
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,400
You got much bigger it takes now for the rest of this lecture I'm going to switch over to my Mac.

102
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,390
All commands will be exactly the same.

103
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:27,050
Because right now we're all on a PC to instance in the cloud so we're all using Linux so all the commands

104
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:34,040
will be the same whether using Windows or Mac to elevate my privileges to rootes I'm going to type sudo

105
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,960
su.

106
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,750
And so now I'm a super user can see or be here it says root.

107
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,430
And so this means I have for admin access.

108
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,580
So we have a little Linux server in the cloud Let's go and make it a web service.

109
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,430
The very first thing we want to do is just run a yum update minus.

110
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,020
Yes.

111
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,270
And this will just update the you know the operating system with all relevant packages.

112
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,490
It means it's got all the latest updates applied to it so that hopefully there will be no vulnerabilities

113
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,610
and that can take just a little bit of time but it's just cleaning up now it's done all the installations.

114
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:14,000
And once this is done what we need to do is we're going to go in and install Apache Apache just turns

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,990
this little server into a web server and then what we'll do is we'll create a little web page just says

116
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,550
hello hoggers or something like that.

117
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,090
So that has now finished updating.

118
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:32,260
Let's clear the screen and to install Apache we just need to write yum install and then hate TTP day.

119
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,390
And then just to remind us why.

120
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,510
For mine yes.

121
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,130
So that has now installed again I'm going to clear the screen so you can find what I'm doing much easier.

122
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,610
So I've installed Apache.

123
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:54,010
The next thing we want to do is we want to start the Apache service so we say service to DVD start and

124
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,900
that has now started the service.

125
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,170
And then we just want to do one other thing.

126
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,010
So the service has started to.

127
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:07,180
The one thing that we want to do is if this to instance reboot we want Apache to come back on automatically

128
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:13,640
so to do that we just type in check config and then hatred DVD and then we say on and that will just

129
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:19,670
means that if we restart this two instance Apache will come on automatically so we can now type in service

130
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,390
HDDVD and then status that will show us if the HD DVD service is running the Apache service.

131
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,540
It is now running.

132
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,640
And when we install that we've created a directory so if we go to CD.

133
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,700
Dub dub dub page Timo This is the root directory of our web server.

134
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,540
We type in l s we can see that there's nothing there.

135
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,730
So let's go ahead and fix that one I'm going to do.

136
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:49,550
I'm going to write to Nannar index dot TMM and we're going to create a little web page so here's a little

137
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:55,460
textedit built into our easy to instance I'm just going to quickly do some code.

138
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,380
So Timo make this really simple so body then hate Schwann so head.

139
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:10,520
And then it's just going to say hello cloud gurus going to endow H-1 again and our body is like literally

140
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,300
the most simple piece of HTML you can do.

141
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:21,210
And we're going to end typed here now and tomorrow and then I'm just going to hit the control X. they'll

142
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,970
ask us if we want to save I'm going to hit yes and then I'm going to hit enter.

143
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,600
And so now if I do ls we can see my little index dot hate himself.

144
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,470
So next thing to do is I'm just going to clear the screen.

145
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,520
Let's go over to the web browser and see this Web site.

146
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:41,440
OK so here I am and my web browser I just type in the IP address or you can see straight away Hello

147
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,290
cowgirl.

148
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,750
So we've created a little web server in the cloud we've created web site and we can now connect to that

149
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,170
web site using our using that public IP address.

150
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,620
So what we now want to do is we're going to look at how we can register a domain name and how we can

151
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,980
point that domain name a to this to instance.

152
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,590
Now before we go on to registering a domain name we need to in the need to create a application load

153
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,540
balance or in order for all this to work.

154
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,670
So let's go in the next lecture and explore.

155
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:17,940
From a theoretical point of view what a what the different types of balances are what's available to

156
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,370
you.

157
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:23,010
And then once we've done that we'll go on and we'll register domain name and we'll point out my name

158
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,550
