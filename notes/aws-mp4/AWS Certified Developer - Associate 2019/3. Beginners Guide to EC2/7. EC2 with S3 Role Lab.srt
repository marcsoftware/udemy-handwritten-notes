00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:06,750
OK hello cloggers and welcome to this lecture this lecture we're going to look at easy to with as three

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,680
roles.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,230
So you might remember in the last lecture we created our secret access key access key ID.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,540
We then ran AWOS configure and we were able to provision a bucket and a copy a file up to that packet.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:27,750
We then basically went into the I-AM console and we went and deleted that Secret Access Key ID and our

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,540
access.

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,780
So now we are no longer able to communicate with the S3.

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,590
And so the next thing we're going to do is we're going to create a role and we're going to give that

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,810
S3 admin access and then we're going to apply that role to a running a C to instance.

10
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,690
So this is a lab and you will need to look into the AWOS console.

11
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,800
OK so I've looked into the AWOS code so I'm going to go over to services and I'm going to go down to

12
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,860
security identity and compliance and click on I am.

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,970
Now we've got our user in here and our users in our group we have a look at our user could develop one

14
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,160
and we can see if we click on developer one that they're inheriting the administrator access from the

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,950
group.

16
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,090
Click on security credentials we'll see actually generated an Access Key ID just for consistency.

17
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,480
Just go ahead and delete that.

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,100
So this you said no longer has any kind of access.

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,020
So what I want to do now is I want to go ahead and create a role.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,360
So if we click on roles it says what roles have roles or a secure way to grant permissions to entities

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,450
that you trust.

22
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:40,410
Basically you allow you to row two resources within AWOS so you could give your E.C to instance you

23
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,900
know you basically create a role that allows you to instance to talk to S-3 where you create a role

24
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,950
that allows Lamda to execute or you create a role that allows Lamda to write things to S-3 or to dynamite

25
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,610
D-B.

26
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,360
If you don't know what Lamda dynamo Bay or any of that is just yet to worry we are going to cover it

27
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,760
in the course.

28
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,570
So what I'm going to do is going to go over here and create a row.

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,580
And in here we're going to create a role for an AWOS service.

30
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,540
You can create a role for another AWOS account.

31
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,130
You can also use it for web identity's.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,900
So this be things like cognito or any open ID provide us like Facebook for example.

33
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,410
And then you can also allow your roles to interact with active directory.

34
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,520
So Semmel two federations so this would be your corporate directory.

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,310
We're going to do this for the AWOS service and we're going to do this for AC too.

36
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,870
This is the most common roles.

37
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,540
Let's go ahead and click on A.C. 2 and go ahead and hit next on our permissions and in here we've got

38
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,980
all our different policy types.

39
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:44,430
Now we could give our easy to instance administrator access but that would be pretty insane because

40
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,310
if that is easy to instance was compromised and somebody managed to hack it and they could then go in

41
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,100
and start provisioning stuff inside Al cloud.

42
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,180
They could go and create other E.C two instances they could go and delete things.

43
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,060
So we don't want to do that we want to have a policy of least privilege certain here.

44
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:08,570
We don't want to do is just type in S-3 and in here we can see that with a policy that is Amazon S3

45
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,670
full access so we can click on that.

46
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,570
You don't actually see what the policies look like.

47
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,320
You can click on the link and you can go in and look at that Jason.

48
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,480
And essentially this is a policy document.

49
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,630
It's all a whole bunch of just keep his so get a version and then we've got our statement and our statement

50
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,240
has some nested rules inside.

51
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,580
So we've got effect allow action S-3 resorts everything.

52
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:38,050
So essentially this Jason is saying are going to allow basically this row to do anything inside S-3.

53
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,830
So we're just going to go up here and close that and come back over so you can you definitely have to

54
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:49,970
understand how to read roles going into this exam so do be aware of that or how to read Jason policies.

55
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,860
So Amazon S3 full access is the one that we want.

56
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,290
Let's go ahead and hit next.

57
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,200
I'm going to call this my three admin access.

58
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:05,610
So that's my real name and the role description allows Acey two instances to code A.W. services on your

59
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,060
behalf.

60
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:13,140
You might want to change that to call AWOS S-3 on your behalf because that this row or only allow us

61
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,710
to interact with x ray we can't do anything else.

62
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,370
So let's go ahead and hit create.

63
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,540
And that has now created our role.

64
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,960
I've got a whole bunch of other roles in here from other courses just ignore that.

65
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,250
You can see the road down here.

66
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:32,800
My S-3 admin access so don't want to do now is I want to go over again too easy too.

67
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:39,470
So I'm going to go to compute and click on E.S. too and what I want to do is apply this row to my Acey

68
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,390
to instance.

69
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,110
But before we do that let's just look back into the two instance and make sure that we definitely cannot

70
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:53,580
access S-3 case here I am in my terminal window going to S-sh over to my Acey to instance going to elevate

71
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,860
my privileges to root.

72
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,660
And I'm going to clear the screen and just type abs s s.

73
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:04,850
LS get an error message saying invalid access ID when calling the list bucket action.

74
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:11,400
Now I could go in and type AWOS configure and do a whole bunch of new you know secret access case an

75
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,520
Access Key IDs.

76
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,450
I'm not going to do that.

77
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,150
What I'm going to do is just tap back over to the AWOS console.

78
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,160
So I'm back in the E.S. to console for eight of us are going to click on my little AC to instance I'm

79
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,350
going to go to actions and I'm going to go over to instant settings and you can see just over here a

80
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:35,880
touch replace a roll soon click in here and I'm going to go ahead and add my S-3 admin access road.

81
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,600
Now note that this box will earn the order to populate with two rolls we can't see any of my Lamda rolls

82
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,340
for example.

83
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,570
So my S-3 admin access I need to go ahead and hit apply.

84
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,010
So that operation has now succeeded.

85
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,240
I didn't need to stop my instance or return to it or terminate it or anything like that.

86
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,130
I just applied it to the instance.

87
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,080
Let's go back over to our terminal window.

88
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,630
OK so I'm back in my terminal window.

89
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:05,520
If I type in AWOS s three Ls I'm going to get the same error message and the reason for this is because

90
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,750
it still has access key ID and secret access keys saved in a little hidden directory inside our Linux

91
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,400
instance and it would do the same in Windows as well.

92
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:22,710
So in order to stop this just go see a search change directory and you want to go to your home directory

93
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,770
and then it's for Slashdot.

94
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,830
AWOS.

95
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,660
And that's a little hidden directory if you type in ls in here you can see the configuration and you

96
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,750
can see your credentials.

97
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:38,980
And in order to stop it from doing this just go in and remove credentials.

98
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,590
Are him credentials that will say remove regular file credentials.

99
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,600
Yes and then you may also just want to do the same with the COM fix or remove config.

100
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,780
Yes if we type Ellefson now will say that there's nothing in there.

101
00:06:53,970 --> 00:07:00,360
So if we go back to our root directory and just clear the screen what we'll do now is just type AWOS

102
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,840
S-3 else it will see that it doesn't have any credentials.

103
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,820
But now the role has kicked in and we can see our S-3 buckets.

104
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:14,970
We've got a cloud Guri one two three four minus k and we can actually go in and have a look at the contents

105
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,360
of that.

106
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,220
So yes S-3 less than three and then a cloud Gary.

107
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:27,160
One two three four hyphen and then our K and you'll be able to see our Hello 0.60.

108
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,800
Then again we could go to an echo.

109
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,640
So hello cloud gurus too.

110
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,980
And we're going to put that out to help too.

111
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:51,640
It takes t takes t and them what we want to do is AWOS S-3 then copy hello to takes t over two three

112
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,520
and then a cloud Gary.

113
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,060
One two three four.

114
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,530
OK that should hopefully copy it up.

115
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,110
There you go.

116
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,430
It's been successful.

117
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,250
And again if we just run that command A.W. S S3 ls and have a look at the contents you'll be able to

118
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,890
see our second text file in there.

119
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:14,670
Now for Windows users if you want to locate way your configuration credential file is in your user profile

120
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,420
and then forwards Slashdot AWOS and you can go.

121
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:23,790
If you just go to Dacosta AWOS Amazon Dot com for slushed Zelaya for slushed latest vote Sless user

122
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,150
guide.

123
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,770
And then it's on to Selye hyphen com fake hyphen files start.

124
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,510
T l.

125
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,730
So what are my exam tips let's go over and have a look.

126
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:38,430
So my exam tips will roles allow you not to use Access Key IDs and Secret Access case.

127
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,530
And if you do lose your access key ideal secret access.

128
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,410
Maybe you accidently save it to a file that you publish and get hub.

129
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:52,950
Anyone can access your AWOS account and if you've given that account administrator access they can literally

130
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,180
do anything.

131
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,770
So they're not very secure.

132
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,440
They're difficult to manage.

133
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:02,880
You have to go and install them on every single easy to instance whereas roles are universal and you

134
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,570
can apply them across multiple E.C two instances and you can't compromise the roles or roles are always

135
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,200
preferred.

136
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,960
From a security perspective if you are given a choice in a US an exam scenario or between Access Key

137
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:24,210
ID and Secret Access case versus rolls always choose roles are also controlled by policies so we saw

138
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:31,290
we added the S-3 admin access policy policies just basically a whole bunch of Jason and it basically

139
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,930
has keypads and it states what you can and can't do.

140
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:39,290
You can change a policy on a row and it's going to take immediate effect.

141
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:47,880
So I could go in there and go into my S-3 admin access policy and start tweaking the Jason and that

142
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,050
will take immediate effect.

143
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,970
I could say OK I want to be only able to read from history I don't want that person to do any writes

144
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,530
As soon as you save that policy.

145
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,710
That would take immediate effect and then most improved that you can attach and detach roles to running

146
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,480
two instances without having to stop or terminate these instances.

147
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,320
It was certainly quite a recent thing.

148
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,260
Many many years that was a very popular exam topic.

149
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:19,120
You used to have to terminate your AC to instance and then recreate it with the role attached but now

150
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,270
you can attach and detach roles to running two instances.

151
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,940
So that is it for this lecture guys.

152
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,500
Remember if you do have a scenario question where you've got roles versus access key IDs and secret

153
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,120
access.

154
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,210
Kids always choose roles.

155
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,750
Do you have any questions please let me know.

156
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,540
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

157
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,060
Thank you.
