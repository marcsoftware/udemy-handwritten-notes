1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:06,340
OK hello cloggers and welcome to this lecture this lecture we're going to look at backups multi-phase

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,390
Z and read replicas with us.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,830
Now it doesn't matter what exam that you're doing whether it's solutions architect associate developer

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,920
associate or city administrator associate having a clear understanding of the difference between Moltke

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:27,270
a Z and read replicas will pick you up at least three or four points on your exam in some exams or pick

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,100
you up more really depends on the exams you need to have a clear understanding of what that is going

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,230
into the exam.

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,150
Before we get onto that though let's just start with some backup.

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:42,930
So there's two types of backups for AWOS these automated backups and there's database snapshots now

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,570
automated backups will allow you to recover your database to any point in time within a retention period

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,850
and the retention period can be between 1 and 35 days.

12
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,730
Automated backups will basically take a full daily snapshot and will also store transaction logs throughout

13
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,340
the day.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,240
And then when you recover AWOS will first choose the most recent daily backup so choose the snapshot

15
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,520
that's most recent and then apply those transaction logs that are relevant to that day.

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,090
And that's how we do a restore with automated backups.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,990
And this basically allows you to do a point in time recovery down to a second within the retention period

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,300
windows the retention period window is between 1 and 35 days.

19
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,960
Now a cool thing about automated backups is they're enabled by default the backup data is stored on

20
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,570
S3 and you're going to get free storage space equal to the size of your database.

21
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:41,330
So let's say you have an instance of 10 gigs you going to get 10 gigs worth of storage that's free on

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,270
S-3 and backout so taken within a defined window during the backup window storage IO may be suspended

23
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,730
while your data is being backed up and you may experience some elevated latency and you saw in the last

24
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:59,460
lecture where we basically defined all backup window we left everything as the default values.

25
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,350
But when you go and create your database you can define the backup window.

26
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,400
You can also edit it for your existing databases.

27
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,060
Moving on to snapshot snapshots is simply what you think they are they're basically a snapshot of the

28
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,440
database so just like a Polaroid takes snapshots.

29
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,070
When we do a database snapshot it's going to take a snapshot of the database.

30
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,090
It's always done manually so that always use initiated and they will always be stored even after you

31
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:33,450
delete the original D.S. instance if you delete the original instance your automated backups will also

32
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,470
be deleted with it as well.

33
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:42,330
Whereas D-B snapshots basically sit as a standalone file and you can delete the LDS instance without

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,360
having to worry about those snapshots being deleted as well.

35
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:52,260
So moving on to restoring backups whenever you restore either an automatic backup or a manual snapshot

36
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,830
the restored version of the database will be a new D.S. instance within DNS and points when we do a

37
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,540
restore.

38
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:06,780
Let's say that this is our DNS end point for the original database we've got original doti hyphen Westhoff

39
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,760
and one to D.S.O. Emerson 8.

40
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,610
So when we do a restore it's going to have a new DNS endpoint so they basically completely separate

41
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,390
databases with completely separate DNS and points.

42
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,130
Now before we have a look at how we go and do this I just want to talk a little bit about encryption

43
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,850
encryption at rest is supported for my sequel Oracle esque sequel serve a purpose gress.

44
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,380
Q Oh Maria D.B and terasa everything now supports encryption at rest.

45
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,350
It's done using the AWOS Kamis or key management service.

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,340
We cover a mess in a awful lot of detail in the certified security specialty course.

47
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,450
So if you do want to go on and get a security certified which is really valuable right now definitely

48
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,620
check out that course.

49
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,010
So once your instance is encrypted the data stored at rest in the underlying storage is encrypted as

50
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,230
all of its automated it backups read replicas and Snapshot.

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,680
So once you encrypt a database anything you do with that database in terms of making a copy of that

52
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,700
data is going to be encrypted as well.

53
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,540
And at the present time encrypting an existing db instance is not supported.

54
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:18,420
To use ADSI encryption for an existing database you must first create a snapshot and then make a copy

55
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,540
of that snapshot and encrypt the copy.

56
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,240
And we'll look at how to do that.

57
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,560
And General backups right now.

58
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,870
OK so here I am in the AWOS console in the audio section which sits under databases and what I want

59
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,590
to do is I want to go over to that a database instance that we launched in the very last lecture.

60
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,860
So go to a cloud and click in here in here we've got our instance actions.

61
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:48,570
So I in here I can create a replica arrayed replica we can take a snapshot restore to a point in time

62
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,200
migrate latest snapshot et cetera et cetera.

63
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,880
I'm gonna explain what read replicas and multi Zee's can also modify the database.

64
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,180
If you click home modify in here you'll be able to scroll all the way down and change the backup retention

65
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,890
period so he can go from seven days all the way down to 35 days.

66
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:12,960
We can also go and change the backup window it is in UTC time so you can say I wanted to start at 2

67
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,420
a.m. or 216 a.m. UTC and have a window for half an hour.

68
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,630
So you can change that all in there.

69
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,810
So let's go and actually let's go click on snapshots in here we can see our automated snapshots.

70
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,040
So these are snapshots.

71
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,170
This was the first snap that was taken when I first created this database.

72
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:38,440
If I wanted to go and do a point in time I'd go back over to my instances click in here and I can go

73
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,580
to instant actions and I can go to restore to a point in time.

74
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,470
Essentially what that's going to do if I click in here and go to custom I'll be able to do the date

75
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,420
the time and it's all in UTC and I can go right down to the very second.

76
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,700
As I said what it's going to do is first restore that snapshot and then it's going to ply with transaction

77
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:04,810
logs to that snapshot and then bring it back to a point in time down to the second so it is really really

78
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,330
cool.

79
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,910
Let's have a look at one last thing before we move on to regret because this is multi ese.

80
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,640
If I click on instances and have a click in here I can go instance actions and I can take a snapshot.

81
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:24,880
Let's go and take a manual snapshot or call it a cloud your manual snap and go ahead and hit take snapshot.

82
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,990
That is now creating my snapshot.

83
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,440
I'm going to pause the video and just wait for this to come up.

84
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,150
OK.

85
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,400
So I'm just going to refresh the page hopefully that has finished being created now.

86
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,210
And there we go it is now available by click in here.

87
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,960
What I can do is I can go to actions and I can go to a copy snapshot when I go to copy snapshot.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,840
I can actually scroll down you can see I can enable encryption.

89
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,380
So that's how we would turn encryption on and basically create a copy and then from that copy that encrypted

90
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,930
copy of the snapshot I would then deploy a new instance.

91
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,960
So that's important to remember your exam.

92
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,290
Now let's learn the differences between multi a.z and read replicas.

93
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,160
So what is multi-phase Z.

94
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,250
Well here we've got an elastic load balance so with some E.S. two instances behind it and they're all

95
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:17,840
pointing at an LDS database this database is in USA aist one a.

96
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,950
So they see two instances if they make any rights to us one.

97
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,600
So any changes to that database.

98
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,260
What will happen is those changes will be synchronously replicated to us.

99
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,620
East one be and U.S. East one bay will be an exact copy of uss aist one a.

100
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,720
Now it's important to understand this is for disaster recovery only.

101
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:46,890
So in the event that we lose U.S. East one way it will automatically fail over to us at least one B.

102
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,050
So how does that work.

103
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,340
If you remember in the last lecture we had the connect up HP file and we had this thing called the hostname

104
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:02,500
and the hostname simply contained our DNS and points a cloud Garou dot see one x w s a 1 K L x t Daut

105
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:07,440
EU hyphen West hyphen one dot Amazon Dot com.

106
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,370
So that is simply a DNS address that DNS address is actually public and publicly available.

107
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,940
And what will happen is that if you lose your primary database Amazon will detect that and it will update

108
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:25,650
the DNS address to point to the IP address of your Z copy of your database.

109
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,440
So it's really important to understand that you never deal with IP addresses when dealing with D.S.

110
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:37,090
you always just use this DNS endpoint and this day NSA endpoint will fail over automatically to your

111
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:45,190
you know your secondary Malte a Z database azy allows you to have an exact copy of your production database

112
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,750
and another availability zone and AWOS handled a replication for you.

113
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,520
So when your production database is written to this right will automatically be synchronized to the

114
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,800
stand by database.

115
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,590
And so in the event of database maintenance or D-B instance failure or an availability zone failure

116
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:08,290
Amazon will automatically follow it to the standby so that the database operations can resume quickly

117
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:14,200
without administrative intervention so files are automatically your downtime is going to be very very

118
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,000
limited probably only a minute or so.

119
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,840
So it's really really critical to remember the multi Asie is for disaster recovery only.

120
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,290
It is not primarily used for improving performance.

121
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,780
If you want performance improvement you're going to need read replicas and it's really critical to understand

122
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:38,770
that any of the associate exams and disaster recovery you using multi azy if you want performance improvements

123
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,330
you are going to use read replicas.

124
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,060
Before we go on what a read replica is just remember that multi azy databases are available for a sequel

125
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,170
server.

126
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,190
Oracle my Sekou post Q Oh Maria D-B.

127
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,440
You could argue or Rore as well.

128
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,870
Aurora is actually built into the entire database design.

129
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:01,270
I haven't put it here as a bullet point but it definitely has Rohrer by it is spread across multiple

130
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,550
availability zones.

131
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,460
You don't need to turn on multiagency for Aurora but the other instances you can definitely turn it

132
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,000
on.

133
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,750
So moving on to read replicas what is a read replica.

134
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:20,460
Well let's take our lastic Lloyd Belon so without E.C two instances as we had in the last few slides.

135
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:24,130
And they're basically doing a right to an audio database.

136
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:30,100
Now when you set up a raid replica these rights are going to be pushed out to other copies of the database

137
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,870
and you can have five read replicas per production database by default.

138
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,160
And so why would you do this.

139
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,490
Well let's say that 90 percent of your traffic is read traffic and you've got all these easy two instances

140
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,600
90 percent of what they're doing is just doing raids from the database.

141
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,090
This could be like a very popular Wordpress blog or popular Joomla site or something like that.

142
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,000
To be honest it depends on the workload.

143
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,290
But a lot of applications a lot of it is read you know people are reading more than they contributing

144
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,570
on the Internet generally speaking.

145
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:07,600
So you know you could scale this out by instead of having those two instances going to the production

146
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,020
database the primary database they read from the read replicas or you could have it so that one reads

147
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,260
from the production and the other to read from read replicas whatever.

148
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,800
This is a way of scaling out your database so that you take the load off the primary database and you

149
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,470
spread that load across one or more read replicas.

150
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,540
You can also have read replicas of Raid replicas you will get some replication latency if you do do

151
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,760
that but you could have a read replica in a nother availability zone but you could have a RAID replica

152
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,830
in a other availability zone or you could have a read replica in a completely different region.

153
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,790
It's completely up to you.

154
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:51,100
So read replicas allow you to have a read only copy of your production database.

155
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,410
This is achieved using asynchronous replication for the primary haughtiest instance to the read replica

156
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:03,310
and you use read replicas primarily for very real heavy database workloads so use RAID replicas to scale

157
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,100
out.

158
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,150
Now I did say earlier the bolt a Z is synchronous whereas read replicas are asynchronous.

159
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,830
You don't actually need to worry about that at any of the associate level questions when you start doing

160
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:19,660
the professional level questions so try and confuse you and try and test whether you know which is synchronism

161
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,680
which is asynchronous but you won't have that at the associate level.

162
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,010
Xrayed replica databases currently available for my sake will serve a purpose.

163
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,560
Q Oh Maria de Bay and Aurora so it's available for fall.

164
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,420
They are currently not available for sale.

165
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,260
Will serve at all for our école.

166
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:43,480
So rate replicas they use for scaling not for disaster recovery if you need to scale out to use read

167
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,490
replicas if you need disaster recovery you want multi azy you must have automatic backups turned on

168
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,450
in order to deploy a raid replica.

169
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:59,570
You can have up to five raid replica copies of any database and you can have a read replicas overread

170
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:05,230
replicas but watch out for latency E-Trade replica is going to have its own DNS endpoint.

171
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,250
You can have read replicas that have multi enabled.

172
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:16,240
This is a very new feature that was released in January 2018 so you can have a RAID replica in a completely

173
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,760
different availabilities zone or completely different region that has multi Asie turned on and you can

174
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,590
create raid replicas of multi Asie source databases.

175
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:32,650
So in other words if you have multi Asie turned on to your you know to your instance you can still go

176
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:39,490
in and create read replicas doesn't break it at all and then read replicas can be promoted to become

177
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,260
their own databases.

178
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:47,730
Now this will break the replication but this can be very very useful if you need a copy of your database

179
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:53,140
maybe you've got too many read replicas you're not using enough of them and you want to do some you

180
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,640
know some other sort of work on your databases and you don't want to do this on your production database.

181
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,590
You can promote your read replica to become its own database.

182
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,640
This will break the replication however.

183
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:10,420
And then finally you can have a read replica in another region it doesn't have to be tied down to the

184
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,630
region in which all production database is in let's go have a look at how we can enable multi a.z and

185
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,730
read replicas in the console case.

186
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:24,610
Here I am back in the AWOS console if I go down to databases and click on relational database service.

187
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,080
So open up the splash screen.

188
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,620
I'm going to go and grab the instance that we were using previously.

189
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:38,440
A cloud are going to go in and click on it so it's selected and then go to instance actions straightaway

190
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:44,910
I can click on Create raid replica You can specify the destination here so it can be completely different

191
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,510
region.

192
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,740
You can specify the subnet groups the availability zones whether it's publicly accessible or not.

193
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:56,650
You can actually enable encryption on your read replicas even if the primary database is not encrypted.

194
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:03,440
You can select your instance classes here you can make Read replica multi a Z and then you just basically

195
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,140
can go and set up monitoring you're going to have an enhanced monitoring or you can have logs exported

196
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,820
to cloud watch logs from your raid replicas as well.

197
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,540
Can Go ahead and hate can so I don't really need to create a raid replica the other way you can turn

198
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:24,260
on multi Asie as you just go over the instance actions go to modify and you can actually just specify

199
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,580
that you want multi Asie deployment.

200
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:32,540
And the way this would typically be done is let's say this is my test dev database and my site is almost

201
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:38,240
ready to go live but I didn't want to have multi azy on test and Dev on what I can do is go into my

202
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,250
database and make up multi azy and thus promoting it to become a production database.

203
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,530
So that is read replicated and multiagency in a nutshell.

204
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:54,200
You do definitely have to have a clear understanding of the two going into any associate exam and pretty

205
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,020
much any professional exam you will always get marks for knowing the difference between the two.

206
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:06,190
I remember raid replicas of scaling for performance enhancement whereas multi azy is for disaster recovery.

207
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,960
You can go back now and delete this D.S. instance going to be using it anymore so just go to your instance

208
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,660
actions and go ahead and hit delete.

209
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,280
I'm not going to create a final snapshot.

210
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,550
You can if you want.

211
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,490
If you aren't going to create a final snapshot it says it.

212
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:27,470
I acknowledge that upon instant solution all my automatic backups including system snapshots some point

213
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:32,510
in time recovery will no longer be available so it will delete all the automatic backups when you delete

214
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,980
your yes instance.

215
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,430
So that is it for this lecture guys if you have any questions please let me know.

216
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,260
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture.

217
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,790
Thank you.
