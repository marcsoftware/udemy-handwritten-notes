1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,540
OK hello cloggers and welcome to this lecture this lecture we're going to start getting our hands dirty

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,700
with AC too.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,980
The best way to learn AWOS is to go ahead and start using it.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,880
So let's look into the AWOS cons..

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,440
OK so I've looked into the AWOS console.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,360
Now I want you to first just take a moment to change all region and I would do the rest of this course

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,510
in the U.S. East in the Northern Virginia region.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,000
And the reason for that is that's the main region where Amazon will release all their news services.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,650
So if you see something that's quite cutting edge in this course and you can't find that new console

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,490
it could be because it's not available in your region.

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,700
So if you can just use us aist Northern Virginia.

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,430
So that's how you change a region.

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:48,030
Now what we want to do is we want to click up here and go to services and we can see compute and straight

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,590
on to compute is AC too.

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,940
So let's go ahead and click in there and what we're going to do in this lab is we're going to set up

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,180
a little web server.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,120
So the first thing we need to do is you get this splash screen.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,330
You can see that this is a brand new account by default.

19
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,600
I don't have anything we want to do is go ahead and launch our first instance.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,110
So instances are created from Amazon machine images and you've got a whole bunch here that you know

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,860
you can choose.

22
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,330
So these are two different operating systems so you could have a amazon Linux or Linux Redhat scroll

23
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,830
down you could have windows et cetera.

24
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,800
Work for this course we're just going to use the Amazon Linux and wine as our default one.

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:32,180
Also note that you have the marketplace here and community and so you can actually go and buy a pre-built

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,910
you know virtual machines to do different things.

27
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,820
So let's go ahead and click on the Amazon Linux am I and then here this is where we do our instance

28
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,380
families.

29
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:49,350
This is where we can select whether we want to micro or if we want to use something that's optimized

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,470
for memory or something that's optimized for compute.

31
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,860
This is where Dr. mkt fight Dr. McK picks comes in.

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,180
So these are all your different instance types so we're going to use tape to my credit go ahead and

33
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,750
hit next configure instance in here.

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,430
This is where we say the number of instances you can have a purchasing option you could request a spot

35
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,510
instance you could go and enter in your price.

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,960
I'm not going to do that in here.

37
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,340
This is the network so we're going to deploy this into our default VTC.

38
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,830
We will cover all bases later on in the course but think of of APAC as just a virtual data center in

39
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,840
the cloud that's unique to you.

40
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,470
We can use the default BBC to use the default subnet.

41
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,780
We'll cover that off Also later on in the course and we want to auto assign a public IP address so when

42
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,380
this is first provisioned we want it to have a public IP address.

43
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,940
We're not going to assign any identity access management roles just yet.

44
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,770
We can do that later on on shutdown.

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,780
What do we want this instance to do.

46
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,150
Do we want it to stop or to terminate.

47
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,520
We just want it to stop enable terminations protection will stop us from accidentally deleting this

48
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:53,970
instance.

49
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,180
You definitely want to do that you know on a production service.

50
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,770
I'm not going to click on that now.

51
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:05,280
Monitoring all instances I'm monitored by default but you can have detailed monitoring detailed monitoring

52
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,640
allows you to monitor it monitors at every every minute as opposed to every five minutes.

53
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,920
I'm going to leave it as a default tendency we are going to run on a shared hardware instance and scroll

54
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,730
all the way down and in here we've got advance details so we can add in user data.

55
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,000
These are bootstrap scripts we're going to cover that offer later on in the course so basically we're

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,340
not making any changes here whatsoever.

57
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,870
We're going to leave everything as default.

58
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,700
We're going to go ahead and hit next to add our storage.

59
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,650
So here's our route.

60
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,810
Device volume or boot volume you can see that it's SSD general purpose.

61
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,510
You can also do provisions to IOPS and you can do the legacy magnetic.

62
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,140
I'm just going to leave it as SSD and we're not going to have an encrypted or anything.

63
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:54,450
You can go in here and add additional volumes if you want but we're not going to do that for this lecture

64
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:00,490
and we're going to go ahead and hit next to add our tags so our tags could just be something like name

65
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,350
and then the value will be my web.

66
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,350
So something like that.

67
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,220
So at any tag that you want.

68
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:14,400
So it's always you could have name you could have department you could have staff ID you know anything

69
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,930
that you want.

70
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,000
And then the value.

71
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,720
And then we're going to go ahead and configure our security groups.

72
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,970
So what is a security group will think of a security group as a virtual firewall.

73
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,290
So this is way you allow traffic in and out to your little instance.

74
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,070
So we're going to need to enable If this is going to be a web server.

75
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,860
People are going to be doing it over port 80 or are the TTP so going to have to enable port 80 in order

76
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,830
for this to work.

77
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,760
So we're going to create a new security group I would call this my web DMZ.

78
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,360
So you know that this is the security great for all your web service.

79
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,750
We're going to allow S-sh in from anywhere.

80
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:58,740
So S-sh is how we're going to connect to our easy to instance use SS hate for Linux of the windows use

81
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,590
Oddy pay it's just article to remotely administer your AC to instances.

82
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,250
So in here we can do this so you can do your IP address.

83
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,390
You could do anywhere.

84
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:15,670
I'm going to select anyway so this is the Sajda notations old old old old old old Ford slash.

85
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,230
And this is that's for IPB for this is for IP basics and this is basically just saying allow anyone

86
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,660
to be able to connect in using SS hige to this instance.

87
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,780
It's not really secure you should really lock it down to your IP address.

88
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:35,580
But this is just a test and Dev server anyway I'm going to go down and we're going to allow TZP access

89
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,120
as well.

90
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,620
And we're going to say we want DTP access from anywhere.

91
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,690
So people will be able to connect to this to instance on port 80 or port 22 on port 80.

92
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,270
They'll be viewing web traffic on port 22.

93
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,020
They'll be administering the server.

94
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,230
So let's go ahead and hit review and launch and then what we want to do is we just want to go ahead

95
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,970
and hit law and she will get this little sort of warning saying that you know the security group is

96
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:05,730
open to the world for S-sh it's not best practice but you know this is just a test and Dev server so

97
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,410
go ahead and hit launch.

98
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,900
Now if you've never done this before you are going to need public and private case.

99
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:18,750
So we are going to create a new key pair and this is how we connect inter AC to instance so this is

100
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,840
how we stop other random people just being able to connect in.

101
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,150
It is literally like setting up a lock on the server.

102
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:31,410
You've got your public key is the lock itself and your private key is the key that you use to open the

103
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,060
locks.

104
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,720
You can share a public case around with anyone but never share your private case soon as you share your

105
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,330
private KPP will be able to access this.

106
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,640
So we're going to call it my new key pair.

107
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,820
Something like that.

108
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,760
And go ahead and download it.

109
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,160
Make sure you save it somewhere safe.

110
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,220
And because if you lose this you won't be able to access your PC to instance if it.

111
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,190
You can say it's Dell.

112
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,030
Man I'm just going to close this and then we're going to go ahead and hit launch instance and that will

113
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,010
now launch our instance.

114
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:07,050
Let's go ahead and view this so it will take a little bit just says pending.

115
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,010
And what I'm going to pull is a video wait for this to go green and then we're going to connect into

116
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,990
this instance.

117
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,640
OK so that instance is now live.

118
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,650
So I will be able to connect to it.

119
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,500
So here's my public IP address.

120
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:23,940
If you just copy and paste that into your clipboard you'll be able to connect using that public IP address.

121
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,470
Now there's a couple of ways you can connect.

122
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,630
You can click click here and go connect.

123
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,870
And it says that you can use a standalone S-sh client which is what I'm going to use and I'll show you

124
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,660
how to do that in both Mac and in Windows.

125
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,320
Or you can use a Java S-sh client.

126
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,080
Now I am running this on crime and it's no longer a supported plug in.

127
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:50,430
So you can try and do it using Internet Explorer or Firefox or whatever but I'm going to use a standard

128
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,070
S-sh client.

129
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,700
So what I'm going to do now is I'm just going to load up terminals so if you are using Windows you can

130
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,240
skip the rest of this video.

131
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,430
Go to the very next video and I'll show you how to log in using Windows using potty.

132
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,830
But if you are a Mac user just follow along with me.

133
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,540
Ok so I'm in find and I've clicked on applications what you need to do is just scroll down to utilities

134
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,380
or open up utilities and you want to open up terminal.

135
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,470
Now my terminal is quite big.

136
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:23,520
You can go up here and go to show and you can go a new window using something like Herberts one of my

137
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,500
favorites.

138
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,460
You can use any settings that will just change the font and the colors and all of that.

139
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:35,090
So I'm just going to use my standard one and so straight away I'm in the Guri directory.

140
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,620
I need to go over to.

141
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,170
So CD downloads and that's where I downloaded my private key.

142
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,250
Now my private key was called My new key pair.

143
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:49,980
The first thing I need to do is to change the permissions on this so I need to make it quite locked

144
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,490
down to be able to connect to my PC to instance.

145
00:08:53,490 --> 00:09:01,850
So what I would do is call type and say S.H. mod 400 my new key pent up pay.

146
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,660
And hit enter.

147
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,050
So that has just changed the permissions on the file.

148
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,790
And now all I need to do to log in is type S-sh AC to high end users.

149
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,830
That's my user name.

150
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,810
And then at.

151
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,950
And then the IP address and then minus I.

152
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,400
And what are we using.

153
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,880
We're using my new key pad.

154
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:28,320
PM And that will then use this keypad to try and connect them via S-sh via port 22 to see two instance

155
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,010
going to hit yes here tied.

156
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,670
Yes.

157
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,890
And it's added that private key to sorry it's added this computer to my list of known Herse.

158
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,490
And then what I need to do is I'm just going to clear the screen so you can see it a lot easier mean

159
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,160
elevate my privileges to route so I'm going to type sudo or su.

160
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,840
And so now I'm a super user you can see here it says route.

161
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,610
And so this means I have for admin access.

162
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:59,580
So we have a little Linux server in the cloud Let's go and make it a web service for the very first

163
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,650
want to do is just run a yum update minus.

164
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,400
Yes.

165
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,490
And this will just update the you know the operating system with all relevant packages.

166
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,690
It means it's got all the latest updates applied to it so that hopefully there will be no vulnerabilities

167
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,810
and that can take just a little bit of time but it's just cleaning up now it's done all the installations.

168
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:25,630
And once this is done what we need to do is we're going to go in and install Apache and Apache just

169
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:32,380
turns this little server into a web server and then what we'll do is we'll create a little web page

170
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,750
just says hello cloggers or something like that.

171
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,310
So that has now finished updating.

172
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:44,180
Let's clear the screen and to install Apache we just need to write yum install and then hate TTP day

173
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,100
and then we'll just do mine this wife of mine.

174
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,800
Yes.

175
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,800
So that has now installed and again I'm going to clear the screen so you can find what I'm doing much

176
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,340
easier.

177
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,840
So I've installed Apache.

178
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:04,850
The next thing we want to do is we want to start the Apache service so we say service hatred DVD start

179
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,240
and that has now started the service.

180
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,320
And then we just want to do one other thing.

181
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,190
So the service has started.

182
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:19,370
The one thing that we want to do is if this to instance read boots we want Apache to come back on automatically

183
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:25,550
so to do that we just type in check config and then hatred TDB day and then we say on and that will

184
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:31,250
just means that if we restart this to instance Apache will come on automatically so we can now type

185
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:38,600
in service HDDVD and then status that will show us if the TSBD service is running the Apache service.

186
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,670
It is now running.

187
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,310
And when we install that we've created a directory.

188
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,970
So if we go to CD.

189
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,880
Dub dub dub page Timo This is the root directory of our Web site.

190
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,090
We type in ls.

191
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,710
We can say that there's nothing there.

192
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,900
So let's go ahead and fix that one I'm going to do.

193
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,770
I'm going to write to Nannar index Daut hate TMLC and we're going to create a little web page.

194
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:07,760
So here's a little textedit built into our easy to instance I'm just going to quickly do some code so

195
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,580
tim will make this really simple so body then hate Schwann so head.

196
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:22,730
And then it's just going to say hello cloud jurors going to endow H-1 again and our body says like literally

197
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,520
the most simple piece of a team or you can do.

198
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:33,170
And we're going to end it here now and TMLC and then I'm just going to hit the control x.

199
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,730
They will ask us if we want to say I'm going to hit yes.

200
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,160
And then I'm going to hit enter.

201
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,390
And so now if I do.

202
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,800
LS We can see my little index don't hate him.

203
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,610
So next thing to do is I'm just going to clear the screen let's go over it all a web browser and see

204
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,720
this Web site.

205
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,220
OK.

206
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:54,430
So here I am and my web browser I just type in the IP address you can see straight away Hello cloud.

207
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,750
So we've created a little web server in the cloud we've created Web site where we can now connect to

208
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,480
that web site using our using that public IP address.

209
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:09,800
So what we now want to do is we're going to look at how we can register a domain name and how we can

210
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,170
point that domain name back to this to instance.

211
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,780
Now before we go on to registering a domain name we need to in the need to create a application load

212
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,740
balance or in order for all this to work.

213
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,860
So let's go in the next lecture and explore.

214
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,900
From a theoretical point of view what a what the different types of light balances are.

215
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,570
What's available to you.

216
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:35,210
And then once we've done that we'll go on and we'll register domain name and we'll point out my name

217
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,750
to our application load balance which will then point out to instance and then you will be able to visit

218
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,990
this Web site just by typing in a domain name.

219
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,810
So if you've got the time please join me in the next lecture.

220
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,300
Thank you.
