1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,430
Say hello cloggers and welcome to this lecture and this lecture we're going to look at how we can monitor

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,900
too with custom metrics.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,930
And as you all know I hate death by PowerPoint so we are going to dive in and start getting practical

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,150
right from the start.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,280
In this course the very first thing I just want to remind you of is what you learned in the last lesson

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,020
and that's that highest level metrics consist of you network disk and the status check.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:31,610
So basically any easy to instance using cloud what you can go in and you could monitor C.P monitored

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,100
network you could monitor disk usage and by disk usage I just mean like disk IO I don't mean the available

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,930
hard disk space left on a virtual hard disk drive.

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,960
And you can also monitor the status of the individual virtual machines.

11
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:52,920
Now what you couldn't monitor by using host level metrics is Ram utilization or even as I just said

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,200
storage of your virtual disks.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:02,250
These are all done using custom metrics and we got to learn how to install a custom metric on our easy

14
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,330
to instance in this lab.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,600
One other thing I just want to point out is that custom metrics the minimum granularity is one minute

16
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,800
we are going to look at the difference between standard monitoring and detailed monitoring.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,860
As I said in the last less than standard monitoring is every five minutes detailed monitoring is every

18
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,910
one minute I'm actually going to create a custom trick that's going to push out stuff to cloud watch

19
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,220
every minute and we'll see whether or not we can pick that up using standard monitoring or whether or

20
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,440
not we use detailed monitoring.

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,120
So this is a lab you will need to look into the AWOS console.

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:35,600
OK.

23
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,590
So here I am in the AWOS console the first thing I want you to look at is the region.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,450
I'm in Northern Virginia.

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,850
I would recommend using Northern Virginia for the rest of this course.

26
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,600
The very reason behind that is it's USDA one that's basically where ABS roll out every single new service

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,120
so it always has all services available.

28
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,270
The one bad thing about us is one is that it is the region that goes down the most.

29
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,840
So maybe if you are running production workloads in the United States you might want to use US West

30
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,630
one or at least have some redundancy around us one.

31
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,230
So that being said the very first thing we're going to do is we want to use a provision in H-2 to instance

32
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,540
and we want to send metrics up to cloud what we need to send some custom metrics such as Ram utilization

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,920
in order to do that.

34
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,470
We're going to need permissions to talk to cloud watch.

35
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,160
So we're going to need to go over to identity access management first.

36
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,060
So you can find I am here on the security identity and compliance.

37
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,570
Go ahead and click on it.

38
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,880
You're going to get this dashboard.

39
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,000
I have used this account the other courses.

40
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,690
That's why you're going to see things like preexisting roles and users and groups just ignore that.

41
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,110
Go ahead and go over to roles.

42
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,730
We're going to create a new role we call this road cloud watch in here the service that's going to use

43
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,650
this row is easy to use so we're going to use the to is going to use this road to talk to cloud watch.

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,870
Go ahead and hit next and here as we create our role we need to apply a policy to the row.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,580
So what we want to do is go and do a search for cloud watch and we're just going to there's a whole

46
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,140
bunch of different cloud watch here.

47
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,350
I'm going to just do cloud watchful Lexis.

48
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,900
That is against lease privilege.

49
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,570
You definitely don't need full access to cloud watch to report ram utilization.

50
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,360
But I'm just doing this as a demo to make things simple.

51
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,850
So go ahead and click on cloud watch full access and go and hit next the roles name.

52
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,520
I'm just going to call it cloud watch and then E.S. too.

53
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,510
So I know exactly what it does and I'm going to go ahead and create the row.

54
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:36,470
We've now created all we can see it in here if you want to go ahead and have a look at the actual policies.

55
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:42,380
It's kind of a pretty basic Jason which is basically just saying action and then cloud watch.

56
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,220
And then the effect allow resource everything etc. etc..

57
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,210
So what we want to do now is go over to services and we're going to click on E.S. too and we're going

58
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,540
to go in and provision our easy to instance.

59
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,620
So we're going to go ahead and launch an instance I'm going to use the Amazon Linux 2 am I.

60
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,180
And I'm going to leave everything as default in here.

61
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,010
I'm going to add in my role so cloud watch easy to do.

62
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,270
And then in here I'm going to run a bootstrap script to show you right now.

63
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,740
So here is our bootstrap script and hopefully this looks familiar to you if you've got no experience

64
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:22,140
bootstrap scripts please go back and do the solutions architect associate course in here.

65
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,260
This is why the way bootstrap scripts always start.

66
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,530
So we start with a shebang which is just the number sign followed by an exclamation mark followed by

67
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,360
forward slash been for a slash Bash and that's just the path to our interpreter and our interpreter

68
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:42,570
basically just takes these commands and runs them at root level when the two instance ferse boots up.

69
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:47,100
So straight away we're updating the AC to instance with all the latest security patches.

70
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,850
And here we are installing a whole bunch of different pills services then changing the root directory

71
00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:00,570
over to easy to use with then downloading our cloud watch monitoring scripts and unzipping it deleting

72
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,280
the zip file.

73
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,040
And that's all that this bootstrap script does.

74
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,270
So actually copy this into your clipboard and here these are the commands that we're going to run for

75
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,230
the rest of this lab but we're not actually going to run them in the boot script so of commented them

76
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,410
out but you will need these commands later.

77
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,420
So like I said copy this into a boat and switch over to your web browser.

78
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,850
And I'm just going to pasted in here and I'm going to go ahead and hit next to add our storage gang

79
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,350
to leave that as default and add some tags.

80
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,270
I'm just going to call it the name of this easy to instance.

81
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:39,780
I'm just going to call it easy to cloud watch cloud watch go ahead and hit next to configure my security

82
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,500
group.

83
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:46,140
Now if you are using brand new account for this course go ahead and create a new security group or might

84
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,350
just do that.

85
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:56,800
Or call it my web DMZ my web DMZ and use the same security group name as my description.

86
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,250
And then I'm going to go in and add some rules to S-sh we want them to the world.

87
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:08,170
I'm also going to allow TTP and allow that open to the world and hey can see the IP for an IP V-6.

88
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,040
Again if this is all new to you and you've never done this before.

89
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,410
Make sure you go back and do the solutions architect associate or developer associate course we do assume

90
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:21,110
that you've already done all this in the previous course so you have some experience with AWOS.

91
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,050
So essentially we're just opening S-sh and hates TDP up to the world.

92
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,250
Let's go ahead and hit review and launch and I'm going to go ahead and hit launch.

93
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,210
I don't actually have a existing keypad that I've saved on this computer.

94
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:40,450
I'm going to create a new key pair are just going to call it my PC two key pair.

95
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,330
OK.

96
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,820
So we go.

97
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,420
I go ahead and hit download.

98
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,410
And that has downloaded that key pair.

99
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,300
And I'm going to go ahead and launch my instance.

100
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,080
Now this will take a couple of minutes to provision.

101
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,390
So I'm just going to pause the video and wait until this is up and running and I have already got my

102
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,770
public IP address.

103
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:05,970
I will copy that into my clipboard and once it is up and running I'm going to S-sh in to my A.C. to

104
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,450
instance.

105
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:10,490
Now again we do show you how to do this in the developer associate.

106
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:17,940
And these solutions architect associate course certainly for Windows users if you're using a party if

107
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:25,190
you don't know how to S-sh in to an easy to instance I do recommend you go watch those courses also.

108
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,990
Alternatively you could just click in here and good actions and hit connect.

109
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,810
And Amazon will give you instructions on how to connect using potty just by clicking on that link.

110
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:40,460
So hopefully everyone knows how to S-sh in to an easy to instance if you don't go back and do these

111
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,720
solutions architect associate course.

112
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,320
So this is the two instances now up and running.

113
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,560
Like I said I'm just going to copy this into my clipboard and I'm going to go over to my terminal window.

114
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,230
Windows uses you should go over to putty.

115
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,900
OK.

116
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,420
So I'm in my downloads directory.

117
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,710
The first thing I need to do is change my case so I created a new key.

118
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,730
I just need to change the permissions.

119
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,010
It was called My easy to keep it up.

120
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,030
PM And so I changed the permissions on that to 400.

121
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,630
I can now use this key and to connect to my easy to instance.

122
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,490
All I need to do is type in S-sh.

123
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,330
Easy to hide the user at.

124
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:25,930
And then the IP address and then the identity and then my E.S. two key pair my two key pair P M and

125
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,550
go ahead and hit enter.

126
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,590
It would then say do you want to show you want to continue connecting here.

127
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,290
Yes.

128
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
And there we go.

129
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,190
Now connected into my instance if you're using party again it's slightly different.

130
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,860
If you haven't if you don't know how to do it go ahead.

131
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,730
More solutions architect so she calls.

132
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,420
We show you how to do it in them.

133
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,330
So what I'm going to do now is going to elevate my privileges to root and we're going to clear the screen.

134
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,890
And I'm just going to type in l s and we can see this directory is there.

135
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:58,130
That's what my bootstraps script has unzipped and installed and I go over to that directory so you see

136
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,170
the AWOS scripts dot man and type in LS.

137
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:07,310
I can see I've got two files in here so I've got the get instant stats and I've got to put instant stats.

138
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,570
So before we do anything with these files I want to head back over to the AWOS console.

139
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,990
OK so I'm back in the AWOS console going to click on services and then what I want to do is I want to

140
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:22,260
go down to cloud watch cloud which is under our management tools and I click in here and if you haven't

141
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,390
used cloud watch before it's going to come up something very similar to this.

142
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,260
Go ahead and click on the browse metrics in the metrics summary.

143
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,440
Now you can see here that I have actually used cloud watch before used it for a whole bunch of things

144
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,410
including API gateway lammed etc..

145
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:42,120
You probably won't see anything in here other than easy to click on E.S. to.

146
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,540
You can see here you've got your per instance metrics now per instance metrics adjust things like your

147
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,590
network in your CPQ disk and then your status check.

148
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,050
So these are the ones that come by default.

149
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:02,500
These are your you know your metrics that come with the cloud watch come with an easy to instance these

150
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,690
not custom metrics.

151
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,470
So to make that very very clear.

152
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:12,260
So I'd go back and go to browse and then click on E.C to we cannot see anything in here other than our

153
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,950
per instance metrics.

154
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,600
Let's go back over to our terminal window.

155
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,810
Come back in the terminal window and the first thing I want to do is I want to go ahead and I'm going

156
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,050
to run a put instance command but I'm going to do this.

157
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:29,150
The bogusly So we're not actually going to put anything into cloud watch we're just going to go ahead

158
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,730
and test it.

159
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,320
So if we Alt-Tab over to our text file we can see the command dizzied.

160
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,010
Yeah.

161
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,130
So we're doing put.

162
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,010
Instance and we're going to put in our memory utilization.

163
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,700
We're going to do use the switches verify and then the Birse.

164
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:49,190
So just copy that into your clipboard go back over to terminal and paste that in and go ahead and hit

165
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,910
enter.

166
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,770
And if your role is working and the command is working and you've been started to the correct directory

167
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,080
you should see this verification completed successfully.

168
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,760
No actual metrics were sent to cloud watch.

169
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:05,510
And we can actually verify that by just going back here and refreshing the screen again you going to

170
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,820
see just per instance metrics you're not going to see anything else.

171
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,960
Well let's go ahead and actually send some data to cloud watch so to do that we're going to use this

172
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,830
command here.

173
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:21,410
And basically we're going to send down memory utilization data memory use data and all memory of available

174
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:21,770
data.

175
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,290
So we're going to put this into cloud watch for the very first time.

176
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:30,500
So copy that into your clipboard go back to your terminal window and go ahead and paste that in and

177
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:36,140
go ahead and hit enter and you'll be able to see here it says successfully reported metrics to cloud

178
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,430
watch.

179
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,330
And here's our reference ID.

180
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:43,640
Now if we actually go back over to our terminal window and hit refresh it might not happen straight

181
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,360
away.

182
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,370
It can it can take up to five minutes because right now we don't have detailed monitoring turned on

183
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,310
we've got standard monitoring turned on.

184
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,880
So it can take five minutes for this to appear.

185
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,560
So I'm just going to pull up the video and wait for five minutes.

186
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,010
OK.

187
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,270
It's been about five minutes.

188
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Just clicked on the boards back on the clutch dashboard back.

189
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,630
We go ahead and click on browse metrics we will now see a new metric.

190
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:11,560
So it isn't actually under ACTC it's under a new thing called Custom name spaces.

191
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,540
And in here we can see a Linux system we click on that we can see our instant site day and we click

192
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:23,630
in here we can see three new metrics we can see our memory utilization our memory available and our

193
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,140
memory use.

194
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,150
And right now there's only a single data point.

195
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:33,860
So we've only pushed this information into cloud watch once what we want to do is go ahead and automate

196
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:37,590
this when we want to push it in every five minutes or even every 1 minute.

197
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:45,740
So let's go back over to our techs bootstrap script and in here you'll be able to see this following

198
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,230
command.

199
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:51,630
And we're going to add this to our Crohn tabs so Krone's just like should do tasks in Windows.

200
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:57,020
Basically you can set a set up to run a command every minute or every five minutes or every month or

201
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,700
every day or every week.

202
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,750
And it will run the command So here's where you specify.

203
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,340
Basically this is every minute.

204
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,380
So we've got the air strikes divide by 1 so we're going to send this command every minute of every day

205
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,180
of every week of every month and we're going to run this route and we're going to run the following

206
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:20,320
command so we're going to put all memory utilization memory use memory available up into cloud watch.

207
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,340
So I'm just going to step back over to my terminal window.

208
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:29,120
I'm going to go over to my PC directory and I'm going to go ahead and type in Nannar and then Crohn

209
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,570
and we're going to go ahead and type in.

210
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:37,070
I typed in Condi but it's actually Krown tab and that is going to open up my contact and I'm just going

211
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,180
to scroll all the way down.

212
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,440
So in here you can see the different wild cards what they say.

213
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:47,090
Basically if you do wildcard to abide by then one will be every minute where you could do divide by

214
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,940
five which would be every five minutes every 10 minutes 15 minutes whatever.

215
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,630
Then you've got every hour every day of the month every month every day of the week.

216
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:02,360
So by pasting this in here what we're doing is we're going to run this command every minute going to

217
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,390
run it over every hour of every day of every month of every day of the week.

218
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,950
And we're going to run that route.

219
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,890
So his using a route and then we're going to run the following command.

220
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,870
We're going to put this information up into cloud watch.

221
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,620
So we're going to go ahead and hit control x.

222
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,880
We're going to go ahead and hit save and we're going to go ahead and hit enter.

223
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:26,130
And that has now is going to run every minute and it's going to push my data up in two cloud watch.

224
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,860
Now I'm going to go ahead and pause the video and then oppose the video for approximately 20 minutes

225
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:36,560
I'm going to watch this day to come in and populate in my cloud watch you know console and oppose the

226
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,630
video right now.

227
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,170
OK so I'm back in the cloud ruched.

228
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,730
So I have left this running for quite a bit of time.

229
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,960
Now if we want to go ahead and have a look let's go have a look at a memory utilization and you can

230
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:53,990
see here straightaway we started getting data points at 9:30 5:00 a.m. And we've been getting data points

231
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:54,710
ever since.

232
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,090
Now we have been sending these data points every 1 minute.

233
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,850
But because I don't have detailed turned on I'm actually only getting five minute intervals.

234
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,540
So you could go ahead and change detailed monitoring on for this easy to instance and then you'd be

235
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,140
able to see it on a minute by minute basis.

236
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,830
But right now it's aggregating it to five minutes.

237
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:19,780
I can see here my memory utilization and I can see here my memory available and I can also see my memory

238
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,210
used in here.

239
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,690
So we do know now that our scripts are sending this information into cloud watch and cloud watch is

240
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,490
now logging all this and storing this data.

241
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:34,630
The cool thing about cloud watches you don't have to just use it for you easy two instances.

242
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:40,810
You can also install the scripts on your on Primm instances and you can have them sending data to cloud

243
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:46,570
which you can use cloud watch as a holistic monitoring tool for both your AWOS environment as well as

244
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,470
your on premise environment.

245
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,810
So where this will come up in your exam is that you need to understand.

246
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,860
Well let's go ahead and have a look at my exam tips.

247
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,330
So like I said at the beginning of this lecture we have a host of metrics so you always get this on

248
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:04,780
your two instances no matter what and you'll be able to monitor the following 4 items so your OCP your

249
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:09,800
network your disk and your status check things like Ewert disks.

250
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,390
When we're talking about disk we're really just talking about disk IO and activity on the disk.

251
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:19,660
We're not talking about things like the amount of storage available on the disk so things like the amount

252
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:25,360
of storage available and your abs volumes or the amounts of RAM utilization you're going to need custom

253
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,430
metrics and that's what we just went and configured in this slab.

254
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:35,740
And also remember that with custom metrics the minimum granularity is one minute in order to see 1 minute

255
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,560
intervals or you will need to have detailed monitoring turned on.

256
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,780
So that is it for this lecture guys if you have any questions please let me know.

257
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,460
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture where we're going to talk about.
