OK hello pluggers and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,920
So this lecture is one of the last lectures in this section of the coast and it's just to remind you

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,230
the difference between cloud watch cloud trail and config.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,440
So learning the difference between these three different services will get you marks or ground as you

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,120
go and study AWOS.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,830
So if we remember cloud watch monitors performance so that's where you're going to monitor things like

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,400
C-p utilization ramp utilization et cetera.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,110
You can either use custom metrics or use the metrics that a builtin member they built him metrics for

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,810
to things like just GCP disk network and then the status checks and then if you need something different

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,570
such as Ram utilization you need custom metrics so cloud watch is all about performance monitoring cloud

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,830
trail monitors your API calls Supai provision in a to instance or an S3 barcode or dynamo D-B table

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:58,400
that will be recorded in Cloud trial told me the time it was provisioned what resource was provisioned

13
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,090
whether it was provisioned successfully supervision that what the IP address is et cetera.

14
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,540
So this is used for auditing and then we have AWOS come fake and this is basically a way I like to think

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,430
of it as a CCTV system.

16
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,120
So it's going to require the state of your AWOS environment and it will notify you of changes.

17
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,710
So if you want to know what your the rules were on your security groups from three weeks ago you can

18
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,870
use config for that cloud watching cloud trail wouldn't tell you that if you wanted to know who provisioned

19
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:33,510
the security groups two or three weeks ago that would be cloud trail if you wanted to know the C-p utilization

20
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,280
of your AC two instances that would be cloud watch.

21
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,350
So in your exam you're going to get a whole bunch of different scenario questions and I'll ask you what

22
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,960
the appropriate service is to do something.

23
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:48,530
So is it really important to know the difference between cloud watch cloud trail and AWOS config.

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,810
So we're almost at the end of this section.

25
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,110
So if you've got the time please join me in the next lecture.

26
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:53,320
Think.
