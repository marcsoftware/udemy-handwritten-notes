00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,090
OK hello cloggers and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,280
So this lecture is on cloud watch and cloud watch is basically is one of the most important services

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,360
that you need to understand inside out when going to sit your exam.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,870
So we're going to look at cloud watch and how we can do monitoring and reporting.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,930
So start with cloud which is basically it's monitoring service to monitor your AWOS resources as well

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,780
as the applications that you run on well yes and cloud watch can monitor things like computer monitors

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,410
things like your auto Schelling groups your elastic load balances route 53 health checks.

8
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:38,970
You can do storage and content delivery so abs volume storage gateway cloud from cetra can also monitor

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,210
things like your database and analytics so these are things like dynamite Bay or less cache nodes are

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,670
instances where lastic that produce job flows redshift et cetera and it can also monitor other things

11
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,600
such as this and estop access and eschewed ops works.

12
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,860
Cloud watch logs estimated charges on your AWOS bills et cetera.

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,040
So the most fundamental important thing to understand going into your exam is what it monitors by default

14
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,880
when it comes to E.S. to and then what you need custom metrics for.

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,610
So by default it meannesses these things called Host level metrics and they consist of basically four

16
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,720
different things three different things from a physical point of view and then a status check.

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,450
So the three different things.

18
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:27,420
You network and disk so components are things like CPQ utilization or network throughput or disk IO

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,410
for example.

20
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:35,060
And then it can also monitor the actual health of both the PC to host as well as the PC to instance.

21
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,220
These are known as status checks.

22
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,260
What it can't monitor is things.

23
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,860
So if you think about it holistically it can see its disk as a whole as a physical piece of hardware.

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,520
What it can't see is the individual.

25
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:53,640
Let's say we go down to the individual virtual disk it see how much storage space is left or is still

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,410
available.

27
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,470
It can't see Ram utilization can't see things like that.

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,870
What it can see is the C.P utilization.

29
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:07,440
It can see things like the network utilization and the overall disk activity so the overall disk throughput

30
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,010
but that's where it stops.

31
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,480
And then it can also do things like your status checks.

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,360
So anything else that falls out of CPQ network disk will status check is a custom metric.

33
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:24,350
So things like Ram utilization for example how much memory is your easy to instance currently utilizing

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,710
all of which has provision to it.

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,920
And so that is what we call a custom metric and we will have a lab coming up which will show you how

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,700
to monitor this.

37
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,590
We're going to use a postscript to go in and configure it on R-S.C. to it since then we're going to

38
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,070
start pushing this these metrics to cloud watch.

39
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,430
So just remember going into your exam if it's not CPQ network or disk or the actual status of the PC

40
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,680
to hardware.

41
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,780
Sorry the easy to host as well as the PC to instance then it's going to be a custom metric and you will

42
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,850
be tested on this through out the exam.

43
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,350
Also it's really important to understand how long cloud watch metrics are stored.

44
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,290
You can retrieve data using the get metrics statistic API or by using third party tools offered by AWOS

45
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:14,560
partners and you can store your lock data in cloud watch logs for as long as you want by default Lovelock's

46
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,010
logs will store you'll log data indefinitely so you can change the retention for low group at any time.

47
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,460
You could just say ok for my age obeys I only want you know data for the next.

48
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,710
For the last two weeks.

49
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,770
But for my you see two instances I want to go all the way back to six months so you can change it but

50
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:39,120
by default it is logged indefinitely and you can also retrieve data from any terminated E.S. to or less

51
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:46,410
load balance instance after its terminations do bear that in mind as well in terms of metric granularity

52
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,220
it really depends on the AWOS service many metrics.

53
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,560
For many default services a one minute but it could also be three minutes or five minutes depending

54
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,810
on the service.

55
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,970
Now you will get a you get basically normal monitoring and detailed monitoring normal monitoring is

56
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:08,070
every five minutes detailed monitoring is ever a one minute and custom metrics so things like Ram utilization

57
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,640
which we'll see coming up the minimum granularity that you can have is one minute.

58
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,020
Now one important thing to note here is if you have just your default cloud watch settings on for say

59
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,340
AC 2 you're only ever going to get five minute data points.

60
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,640
That's even if you do have a script that's pushing data to cloud watch every one minute cloud watch

61
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,870
will actually aggregate that over the five minutes.

62
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,320
And again we're going to see that in the lab coming up terms of alarms you can create an alarm to monitor

63
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,350
any Amazon Cloud watch metrics in your account and this can include easy to CPQ utilization elastic

64
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:49,410
load balance and latency or even the charges on your AWOS bill and you can set the appropriate thresholds

65
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,300
in which to trigger the alarms and also what kind of action should be taken if an alarm state is reached

66
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,420
and we're going to cover this off in a subsequent lecture.

67
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:04,000
But you could just tell it to an S and S notification saying oh look up the owner of a $10 Oh my NWS

68
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,150
account for this month.

69
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:10,190
Or you could even have it trigger lambda function which goes through and just starts deleting all your

70
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,290
infrastructure it's entirely up to you.

71
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:19,420
But Cloud watch alarms can basically trigger an action to be taken which you would go in and configure.

72
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,340
And yeah it's really really powerful stuff.

73
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,470
So onto my exam tips just remember what cloud watches it's a monitoring service to monitor your AWOS

74
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:34,120
resources as well as applications that you run on AWOS your host liberal metrics oyes consist of Seip

75
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:41,500
you network disk and your status check if it's asking you about a metric outside of this such as Ram

76
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,250
utilization or even the amount of storage space left on a virtual hard disk.

77
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,970
You're going to need custom metrics or ram utilization is a custom metric.

78
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,370
I remember that full custom metrics the minimum granularity is one minute.

79
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:02,180
So moving on terminated instances you can retrieve data from any terminated AC two or elastic load balancing

80
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:08,370
instance after its termination and cloud watch Loeb's by default a stored indefinitely.

81
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,820
And then finally just remember with your metric granularity So you have one minute for detailed monitoring

82
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,130
and five minutes for standard monitoring.

83
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,410
You may get some scenario based questions just asking you for two minute monitoring.

84
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,940
And how would you achieve that.

85
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,200
Well you're going to need to use detailed monitoring rather than standard monitoring.

86
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,840
And one thing I didn't really cover off in this lecture.

87
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,520
But one thing you should definitely be aware of is that cloud watch can be used on premise as well.

88
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,150
It's not restricted to just AWOS resources.

89
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:44,120
You can definitely use this inside your or your own data center and you can have the metrics being reported

90
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:51,710
back to your cloud watch dashboard you know inside AWOS from your own data center and the way you do

91
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,270
this is you need to download and install the SS agent.

92
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,980
Then once that's installed you need to download and install the cloud watch agent.

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,110
So that is it the dyslexic guys in the next lecture we're going to go ahead and start getting our hands

94
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,960
dirty with cloud.

95
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,130
So if you've got the time please join me in the next lecture.

96
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,450
Thank you.
